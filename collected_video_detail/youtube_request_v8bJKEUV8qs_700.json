Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice Batcave\nCrime and vengeance reach epic extremes in the new movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Now you can join forces with Batman from dusk to dawn at his multi-level Batcave and Wayne Manor headquarters! This deluxe play set is loaded with Super Hero features like the rooftop Bat-Signal with rotating angles, interchangeable weaponry, high tech traps, the infamous underground command center, new secret defense tactics and more.\n \n2.) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Remote Control Skateboarding Mikey\nRC Skateboarding Mikey brings the most extreme member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to life with this innovative, new remote control vehicle. By using the remote control you can watch Mikey perform awesome moves like 360's, 720's, 1-foot spins and wheelies. Mikey even includes self-righting action, which means if he falls over you can use the remote to get him back up and keep going. RC Skateboarding Mikey comes with 20 of Mikey's most popular catchphrases from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series, which gives this toy personality as well as extreme performance.\n \n3.) Imaginext DC Super Friends Super Hero Flight City\nYoung Super Heroes' imaginations will be flying high when they combine two worlds into one with the Imaginext Super Hero Flight City playset. 4 Power Pads get the action started. Turn the top Power Pad on the Gotham City side to have kids' favorite Super Hero take flight. Just load Superman or Batman into the flight pack and have him circle the city looking for trouble. (The Power Pad works just like a remote. How kids turn it determines how high or low or fast or slow the flight pack goes. It even provides 360-degree flying action!).\n \n4.) Tyco Terra Climber Remote Control Vehicle\nClimb and crush obstacles with the ultimate climbing creature\u2014 Terra Climber! This fully functional RC vehicle includes everything you need to conquer obstacles indoors or outdoors! When the creature's tail is extended it's an epic two feet long! The Terra Climber can actually scale stairs up to eight inches high, climb piles of rocks and hills in any direction. Climb and conquer obstacles right away with the Terra Climber Radio Control Vehicle\u2014 it's ready to run with 9.6v rechargeable batteries and charger included!\n \n5.) Paw Patrol Zoomer Marshall\nMeet Paw Patrols Zoomer Marshall! This interactive pup really comes to life: walking, talking, spinning, and more, all on his own! With the wave of your hand, you can get him to follow you, just like a real pup!
