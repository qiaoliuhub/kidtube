This is FUN!!\n\nWhat is Indoor Playground\nIndoor playgrounds, also known as indoor play centers, are playgrounds located in interior environment. They are specifically designed for kids to play in and have tremendous fun with. The soft-contained structure and play equipment are wrapped in soft foam to absorb the impact when children fall or bounce around. As such, an indoor playground is usually a safer play area compared to an outdoor playground.\n\nSince its origination in 1990\u2032s from the US, indoor playground has enjoyed immense popularity all over the world. Today, it has evolved from simple indoor climbing frame, to complex children play center that includes multiple play areas serving different age groups.

They are specifically designed for kids to play in and have tremendous fun with. The soft-contained structure and play equipment are wrapped in soft foam to absorb the impact when children fall or bounce around.

I have kept postponing this exercise for the longest time. I however asked my daughter one time if she could give out her toys to other children who didn\u2019t have and she said no. she told me \u201cthey are mine, they are not for them\u201d. She was young though,  she had just turned 3 years. I realised that she didn\u2019t understand what giving to the needy meant and it has been a journey since then. \n\r\nSo today we are almost 4 years and we got to do some toy decluttering.\n\r\nThis is how it started:\n\r\nI was leaving my bedroom ending to the kitchen then I thought \u201cShani needs to colour, I haven\u2019t seen her colour in a while\u201d. So I decided to get the colours for her to do the colouring\u2026. Wacha nitafute (then I looked for) the colours! There is this big bag where she puts her toys and the bag was just so full. After a long search I decided to do the necessary. I called up Shani and agreed that we were going to sort out her toys. \n\r\nHere\u2019s what we did:\n\r\n1. We had a chat on how we were going to do the decluttering. We decided that we were going to choose the toys she uses most often and keep them. The toys she doesn\u2019t use and feels like she can give away, we were going to keep them on a corner somewhere for \u201cgiving\u201d, then later put them in a bag and give them out. The ones that are spoiled we were going to throw them away.  This discussion was made easy by our family lifestyle of simple living. Shani has seen me Vlog on decluttering, tidying up, giving and saving money. Some Vlogs I have done with her and so she could associate with simple living values. \n\r\n2. We then picked the toy bag, lifted it up and poured everything on the floor.\n\r\n3. We picked one garbage bag for putting up the toys for giving away. The broken ones we just picked one of the toy bags we were going to dispose and made it home for the spoiled ones. \n\r\n4. We then started sorting out the toys. We picked each toy, in fact the word is touched. I lifted each toy and asked Shani which bag it was going to. She then picked the item from me and evaluated it then put it on the right bag. All this time we talking about it. Who are we going to give it to? And Shani agreed that our house help who has a granddaughter needed some of the toys then the rest we could give to another children\u2019s home.\n\r\n5. So then we packed Shani's toys in smaller boxes (those that needed to be in a box) and then put them in her big toy bag.\n\r\n6. We asked Josephine (house help) to come pick toys for her grandchild and then we packed the rest and put in a bag that we are taking to the children's home.

Not a cheap, easily breakable type of thing. Great quality.\nI got this toy as decoration for my fantasy themed room. It is absolutely gorgeous. A little smaller than I would have liked. (Photos: I compared it to another horse figure I have and an old Barbie horse.\nIt is much smaller than both, but that just leaves more room on my shelf.) As a toy for kids, I think it is a little too nice. I think it works better as a decoration than a play toy.\nAlso, the hair is gorgeous, but it is a little sharp in some places. I accidentally scraped myself on It and it actually left a mark on my skin, so I would recommend that kids be very careful with it.\nOverall great, beautiful unicorn.

(Photos: I compared it to another horse figure I have and an old Barbie horse.\nIt is much smaller than both, but that just leaves more room on my shelf.) As a toy for kids, I think it is a little too nice. I think it works better as a decoration than a play toy.\nAlso, the hair is gorgeous, but it is a little sharp in some places. I accidentally scraped myself on It and it actually left a mark on my skin, so I would recommend that kids be very careful with it.\nOverall great, beautiful unicorn.
