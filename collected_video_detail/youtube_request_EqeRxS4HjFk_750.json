This is a great kid play area center for kids playing and having fun! This kid's play centre is lots of fun with giant slides, big bouncy balls, jumbo balloons, ball pit, inflatable slides, bounce house and giant legos. The kids have a great time laughing, climbing, jumping around, sliding, spinning in a top, swinging and riding Disney cars.\n\nLittle kids sliding down a slide is funny, but a 50 foot slide is even better. Jumping around in the ball pits with all the colorful ball had all the children laughing. We even learned colors in in the ball pit too! There was even a toddler area for the preschool kids to play and have fun. The it was  a great family fun time.
