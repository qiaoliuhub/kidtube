Top Toys Chosen by Kids", "description": "SURPRISE TOYS OPENING CHRISTMAS PRESENTS with Walmart  Top Toys Chosen by Kids! This kids video is sponsored by Walmart and thank you Walmart for providing all the toys! \nRyan from Ryan ToysReview opening lots of kids toys! Perfect Christmas Presents for kids! Fisher-Price Imaginext Ultra T-Rex, Hot Wheels Terrain Twister Remote Control,  Paw Patrol Mission Chase, and Fisher-Price Little People Big Animal Zoo! \n\nToys Surprise see in this videos include:\n1.) Fisher-Price Imaginext Ultra T-Rex\nYour little dino lover's imagination gets a gigantic boost from the bony Imaginext Ultra T-Rex, with three Power Pads to bring him roaring to life. Turn the Power Pad behind his tail and he starts walking. A turn of the Power Pad above his left hip allows him to stand to his full height of 2-1/2-feet tall \u2014 and activates the LED lights in his spikes and his eyes. And when you turn the third Power Pad, his mouth opens and closes with awesome chomping sound effects \u2014 and even fires projectiles! If that isn't enough to scare away enemies, he has two boulder launchers in his chest that can be fired at the push of a button \u2014 and a projectile claw! With realistic sound effects while he's walking, standing and firing projectiles, this scary dino makes no bones about it. He's ready to conquer prehistoric lands \u2014 and the imaginations of young adventurers everywhere! Imaginext...Turn on Adventure!\n\n4.) Hot Wheels Terrain Twister Remote Control\nAll terrain all the time! No matter what the season, these insane vehicles can tackle it! Featuring sleek pivoting pontoons with unique corkscrew treads, the vehicles in this assortment are virtually unstoppable as they twist over almost any surface! The R/C controller puts kids in the driver's seat. The simple-to-use device has two buttons that can direct the vehicles forward, backward or even side-to-side. Available in red, green and orange. Each sold separately, subject to availability. Colors and decorations may vary.\n\n3.) Paw Patrol Mission - Chase \nMission Chase is on the case! Now kids can join him on 24 real rescue missions! Just press his badge and Chase comes to life, taking you on guided rescue missions! His spring-loaded backpack self deploys when he needs his tools. Chase can shoot his net for rescuing animal friends and his flashlight is perfectly suited for night time missions. His backpack can also be used manually and includes a special Pup Pup Boogie Surprise! Watch Chase sing and move his head to Pup Pup Boogie! Together, your child's imagination will be lit up with pup-inspired rescue missions full of friendship, teamwork and bravery. It's Mission Chase and you to the ruff-ruff-rescue!\n\n4.) Fisher-Price Little People Big Animal Zoo\nThere's so much to discover at the Fisher-Price Little People Big Animal Zoo! The BIG elephant's legs, ears and head are moveable so kids can learn about and recreate animal movements. Pressing down on the mouse sitting atop the elephant's back, tipping the elephant's head or pulling his tail will all activate music or silly sounds. And if the Zookeeper is too slow bringing the food, the sneaky elephant can tip the platform and his food will roll right into his feeding bin! There's a teeter-totter treetop for the monkey to rock back and forth and a real working swing. Best of all, little animal lovers can use the hose, measuring stick, scale and eye chart to help the Zookeeper and Mia clean, measure, weigh and care for the animals! Little hands and minds will stay busy for hours when they visit this zoo!\n\nMusic Used:\n\"Up on a Housetop\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1Id4_7HlVY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1Id4_7HlVY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1Id4_7HlVY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1Id4_7HlVY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1Id4_7HlVY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Ryan's World", "tags": ["Surprise Toys", "Toy", "toys", "Toy surprise", "Opening Presents", "Presents", "Christmas Presents", "Christmas", "Toys Collectors", "Walmart", "top toys", "Ryan ToysReview", "Imaginext", "Imaginext toys", "Dinosaur Toys", "Ultra T-Rex", "Fisher-Price", "Little People Big Animal Zoo", "Hot Weels", "Terrain Twister", "Paw Patrol", "Paw Patrol Mission Chase"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "SURPRISE TOYS OPENING CHRISTMAS PRESENTS WALMART!
