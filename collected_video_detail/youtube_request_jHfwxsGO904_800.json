The Heartlake Performance School 41134 is a really big building with not a lot inside. But the set comes with an awesome old-school yellow school bus for the aspiring stars to arrive in. I like the addition of the old brown beat up rehearsal upright piano in the ballet studio. And it's nice to meet a new character, Miss Iva the ballet mistress and to see a boy minidoll included in the set as well.\n\nLearn to sing, dance and play with friends in Heartlake City!\n\nPlace all your kit in the locker room and head up to the classroom for your first lesson in the performance arts! Practice your music and moves in the studio before meeting friends in the canteen for lunch. Then put on a spectacular music and dance performance in the school grounds and catch it on video camera.

We have traveled to every fast food restaurant in the galaxy to collect the coolest Transformers, Power Rangers, Ben 10 and every other superhero in between. Our exclusive collection of Marvel Comics heroes, like Iron Man, will impress any serious collector, but if you want to take play outside check out our series of Mattel race cars and nerf guns. You never know what you are gonna find here on FastFoodToyReviews!\n\nAbout FastFoodToyReviews\nThink toys are limited to Toys R Us and other big Toy Stores? Well, not here at FastFoodToyReviews! We know some of the best toys come from the Fast Food Toy Chest. Join us as we scour every McDonald\u2019s Menu for the newest Happy Meal toys, travel to every Burger King for the newest movie collectable, and check out every Wendy\u2019s --- but that\u2019s more for the delicious Frosties. For years fast food restaurants have always made toys with our favorite characters, like Scooby-Doo, Disney classics like Toy Story and the Nickelodeon gang, but it took a true collector, like FastFoodToyReviews to find and collect them all.
