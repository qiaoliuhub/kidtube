She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.\n\nGeorge Pig\nGeorge is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019\n\nMummy Pig\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.\n\nDaddy Pig\nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses.\n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel! \n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\n#Peppa #PeppaPig#LearnwithPeppaPig #PeppaPigEnglishepisodes #PeppaPigEnglish #PeppaPigSongs #Nurseryrhymes #Kids \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.\nPeppa Pig created by Mark Baker and Neville Astley.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_4ObkuCocI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_4ObkuCocI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_4ObkuCocI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_4ObkuCocI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_4ObkuCocI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Peppa Pig Surprise", "tags": ["learn with Peppa pig", "peppa pig learning", "peppa pig", "peppa pig English", "peppa pig English episode", "learning with peppa pig", "peppa pig learn English", "Peppa", "counting for kids", "education", "children learning", "kids videos", "surprise eggs", "abc", "learning videos", "123", "learning videos for toddlers", "learning English", "numbers for kids", "learn colours", "learn colors", "learn alphabet", "learn color", "learn shapes", "peppa pig abc", "learning for children", "colouring", "alphabet", "learning with Peppa pig"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Peppa Pig - Learn to Draw Fruits with Peppa! \ud83c\udf4eDrawing for Kids - Learning with Peppa Pig", "description": "\u2606 Subscribe for more Learn With Peppa Pig videos: http://bit.ly/LearnWithPeppaPig\n\u2764\ufe0f  Watch latest videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPbaYVV5uHQ&list=PLinVG_AbsqohH6aJd3nsrIN4IV7waqsOR\n\nLearn numbers/counting with Peppa Pig: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinVG_Absqoh2ipo9EKmmeqHp23F74DtN\nLearning colous/colors with Peppa Pig: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinVG_Absqoh_8zKA9HYMDQ7qN052k0AM\nLearn Alphabet/ABC with Peppa Pig: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinVG_AbsqohDeTuZpkbUvKGG3lMxna6V\nPeppa Pig Surprise Eggs:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmY4kdOH1tU&list=PLinVG_AbsqoiewXhpuAyJyjJAtm-hNLUE\nColouring with Peppa Pig:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDAK4J3t1g&list=PLinVG_AbsqogTnl0cpHjduNcz8YUcZH56\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nWelcome to the Peppa Pig Surprise channel!

Try Kids Academy Talented & Gifted app with 3-day FREE TRIAL https://bit.ly/2GJLsU8 Learn How to Read for Kids\nLearning a language is a very easy task for kids. Their brain is hardwired to learn a language, therefore, they do not need to be taught how to speak. But reading does not come naturally. Kida has to learn how to read. Several necessary measures are taken and methodologies are applied. According to the new strategies developed about how to read for kids in 2018, this is what needs to be done.\n\n1. Give the Child Phonemic Awareness\nTo teach kids how to read, it is important to first introduce them to Phonetics. They need to know that speech is made up of individual sounds. Learning strategies and educational videos with sounds should be used to give the kids phonemic awareness. However, there is a difference between speaking and writing.  In order to learn how to read it is important for the kids to recognize the marks that represent the sounds of the language that they learned. These marks are actually the alphabet.\n\n2. Give the Child Alphabetic Awareness\nSimply memorizing the alphabet is not enough for reading. In order to develop reading, readiness kids need to learn the letters. It is a complex procedure to tell the kids it identify which sounds go with which alphabet. We have 44 sounds and 26 alphabets. To make this simpler try to use educational videos and games of phonics to help the kids to match the sounds with the letters. Get them phonics letter sets and sound writing boards to make this learning fun.\n\n3. Give the Child Sound to Word Awareness (Blending)\nOnce they can identify the sounds and matching letters. It is time to teach the kids the blending of sounds to recognize the printed words. For example \u201cCat\u201d is represented by three letters c \u2013a-t and has three sounds. Teach the kids how these sounds blend together to make the word Cat. \n\nKids are inherently curious, so once they have the awareness of words the process gets easier. Now is the time to give them interesting books of short stories and read for kids. They will start to follow after you and will eventually develop fluency.\nSubscribe to our channel: https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr\n\n#TalentedAndGifted #LearnWithKidsAcademy\n\n*****\n\nConnect with us on :\n\nApp Store: https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8\nGoogle Play: https://smart.link/597210af6eb83\n\nOur website:  http://www.kidsacademy.mobi\nFacebook:      https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...\nTwitter:           https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57usUoHluMQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57usUoHluMQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57usUoHluMQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57usUoHluMQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57usUoHluMQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Kids Academy", "tags": ["learn to read", "Learn How to Read", "learn how to read for kids", "videos for kids", "educational videos for kids", "videos for kids to watch", "videos for kids funny", "videos for kids to learn", "videos for kids on youtube", "learn to read with phonics", "learn to read kindergarten", "learn to read books", "learn to read apps", "Kids Academy", "learning alphabets", "phonics", "learning english", "Kids", "educational videos for kids 5 years", "learn", "english", "learn to read for kids", "learn to read phonics for kids"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Learn to Read for Kids | Educational Video for Children | Kids Academy", "description": "Thousands of parents and educators are turning to the kids\u2019 learning app that makes real learning truly fun.
