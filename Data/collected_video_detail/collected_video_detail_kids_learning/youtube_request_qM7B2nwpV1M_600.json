They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.\nThis letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.\nAll of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.\nYour children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.\n\nListening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  \nThe very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let\u2019s Learn About the Alphabet Series.

Today we are going to learn about\u2026 the Moon.\n\nThe Moon is the only satellite that rotates around our planet and it takes 28 days to completely go around the Earth. But, do we now what a satellite is? A natural satellite is any kind of celestial body that rotates, or actually, orbits around a planet.\n\nThe Moon is never still, it moves and in two ways. It has a movement of rotation, which means it turns in its own axis, and a movement of translation, that is to say, it rotates around the Earth. \nThe duration of the movement of rotation and translation is 28 days. Because it takes the same amount to rotate on its own axis and to completely go around the Earth, the Moon always shows us the same face.\n\nWhen we observe the Moon along a period of time it appears to change shape. These changes in appearance are called lunar phases and they repeat every 28 days. There are four: full Moon, first quarter, new Moon and last quarter. The Moon phases are produced by two reasons: the movement of the Moon around the Earth and because the Moon reflects light form the sun as a mirror.\n\nNew Moon\nIn this phase the Moon is passing between the Earth and the Sun. The illuminated face of the Moon is facing the opposite direction to Earth. The dark side ends up facing the Earth, and this is why we cannot see the Moon.\n\nFirst Quarter\nYou can see it approximately one week after the new Moon.  One half of the illuminated side faces the Earth. It is called the first quarter because, from the new Moon phase, the zone illuminated by the sun grows every time.\n\nFull Moon\nApproximately a week after the first quarter, we can see the whole Moon illuminated. The Earth is between the Moon and the sun and we can see it fully.\n\nLast Quarter\nThe Moon presents its other half face illuminated. The name of the last quarter comes from the fact that the illuminated side becomes smaller and smaller each time\n\nA very easy trick to now whether the Moon is in its first or last quarter is the following. If the Moon has the shape of a C, it is in its last quarter and if it has the shape of a D, it is in its first quarter.\n\nSo now you know, the Moon has 4 phases:\nNew Moon, first quarter, full Moon and last quarter.\n\nKnow we are going to learn a few facts about the Moon\n\nDo you know the distance between the Moon and the Earth? Although it looks as though it is not very far away, the Moon is about 385,000 kilometers from the Earth.\n\nAnother very interesting fact is that a rocket takes three days to get to the Moon. Its incredible, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe first astronaut that stepped on the Moon was Neil Armstrong and this very important accomplishment occurred in the year 1969 aboard the Apollo 11 rocket.\n\nThe Moon is 4 times smaller than the Earth, but it is very important for the sustainability of life in our planet. The Moon generates tides; Do you now what that is? A tide is the rise and fall of the sea level. They occur every 6 hours approximately.\n\nWell now you know a little bit more about the Moon, very interesting, right?\n\nBye friends and don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the Happy learning channel.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-b4XvuQo1Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-b4XvuQo1Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-b4XvuQo1Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-b4XvuQo1Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-b4XvuQo1Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Happy Learning English", "tags": ["the moon for kids", "learning videos for kids", "educational videos for children", "videos for kids", "the moon and its phases", "organic learning", "kindergarten learning videos", "the moon for kindergarten", "learning the moon", "nursery rhymes for kids", "moon movements", "moon", "videos for toodlers", "learning for kids", "ABCkidTV", "abc songs for children", "youtube kids", "satelite", "kids learning videos", "the moon video", "video for learning the moon", "learning", "school", "children", "kindergarten videos", "kidscamp"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Moon for Kids - Learning the Moon | Educational Video for Children", "description": "Happy Learning is channel for kids.
