V. Prasad Starring : Jeetendra, Tanuja, Sanjeev Kumar, Anjali, Manmohan Krishan, Durga Khote, Bela Bose, Roopesh Kumar, Jagdeep. Music Director : Laxmikant Pyarelal, Lyricist : Anand Bakshi, Singers: Lata Mangeshkar, Mohd. Rafi, Asha Bhonsle , Usha Mangeshkar, Bhupendar, Hemlata.\nSynopsis : Desperate to earn money to support his extended family, Mohan becomes entangled in a web of deceit when he tells a lie in order to obtain a secretarial job in the city with the wealthy Mr Rai. He says he isn't married. But he is. Mr Rai has a daughter with a heart condition. She's confined to a wheelchair but Mohan has more than a mild therapeutic effect on her and she is soon up and running - running after him. Meanwhile, back in the village, the money he has been sending home is being filched by his greedy sister.

Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.\nStrangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).\nOne night, Toomai's father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai's father is killed. Kala Nag's grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.\nPetersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job. When Rham Lahl beats the elephant, however, Kala Nag injures his tormenter. The mahout insists that Kala Nag be destroyed, as is the law. Petersen manages to get him to change his mind and accept 100 rupees instead by threatening to have him removed from the safety of the camp.\nUnaware of this reprieve, Toomai takes Kala Nag and runs away into the jungle. There, they stumble upon the missing wild elephants, and Toomai sees them dancing. He leads Petersen to them. The other natives are awed, and hail him as \"Toomai of the Elephants\".

There, they stumble upon the missing wild elephants, and Toomai sees them dancing. He leads Petersen to them. The other natives are awed, and hail him as \"Toomai of the Elephants\". Machua Appa offers to train the boy to become a hunter, a plan Petersen approves.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/DkIa/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"An American in Berlin? - Oliver Hardy ~ with Philip Hutchinson\" \n\u27a8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joj2rg0j4n8\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~- Donate for our restoration project of historic material: http://www.leetchi.com/c/pool-von-interpathe-16620838"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H13M54S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "19383", "likeCount": "84", "dislikeCount": "6", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "7"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn", "/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "I92StAdJJmvlTH2CGyrZEosmMt0", "id": "SbPio7lzskg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-09-20T01:00:00Z", "channelId": "UCk5bIh544LgQ2_ecTQQ5wQg", "title": "THE BUTTERFLY | Great Book of Nature | Full Episode 15 | English", "description": "In the first part of the episode, a swan asks a bear to help recover a stone flower that has fallen into a fountain in so blocking the drain.

Venkateswaran. It stars Rajinikanth, Mammootty and Shobana in the lead roles with Arvind Swamy, Srividya, Amrish Puri, Bhanupriya, Nagesh, and Charuhasan playing supporting ones. The theme is based on the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. The score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film, which features the last collaboration of Mani Ratnam and Ilaiyaraaja,[1] was dubbed and released in Telugu and Hindi as Dalapathi\n\nDirected by Mani Ratnam\nProduced by G. Venkateswaran\nWritten by Mani Ratnam\nStarring Rajinikanth, Mammootty, Arvind Swamy, Jaishankar, Amrish Puri, Srividya, Bhanupriya, Shobana, Geetha\nMusic by Ilaiyaraaja\nCinematography Santosh Sivan\nEdited by Suresh Urs\nProduction company : G. V. Films\nDistributed by G. V. Films\nRelease date : 5 November 1991\n\nPlot: Surya (Rajinikanth), the abandoned child of fourteen-year-old unwed mother Kalyani (Srividya) is brought up by a generous lady living in the slums. He grows up to become a hot tempered youth who fights the injustice that takes place daily. These qualities lead him to cross swords with the local don Devarajan (Deva) (Mammootty). Deva's friend Ramana is fatally beaten up by Surya, and Deva threatens that if his friend was laid to rest then he will kill Surya. Ramana succumbs to his wounds, and Surya is imprisoned. However, when Deva discovers Ramana's offence, he decides to get Surya released from jail.\n\nSurya is surprised to see Deva send his man to get him out from jail, and there he tells Surya, Nyayamnu onnu irrukku (there is such a thing called justice). From that moment, Deva surrenders his ego and offers his hand of friendship to Surya. Surya pledges that he has nothing else but his life to give his new friend. From then on Deva makes Surya his \"Thalapathi\" (commander). Meanwhile Surya falls for a local girl Subbulakshmi (Shobana). They soon fall in love and their relationship continues. Surya and Deva virtually rule the town with their muscle and their sense of justice, but in the eyes of the government they are anti-social elements. Arjun (Arvind Swamy), posted as the new district collector, plans to arrest both so that he can end their brutal activities. But his opportunities are futile.\n\nAt this time, Deva and his wife go to Subbulakshmi's house asking for her betrothal to Surya. But her father refuses stating he cannot marry his daughter to a person who doesn't know about his parents. Instead, Subbulakshmi is married to Arjun. Surya eventually marries another girl (Bhanupriya) who was widowed by him earlier (her husband was Ramana). Surya, still troubled by the guilt, prefers to remain as a guard to the widow and her daughter.\n\nA struggle breaks out between the collector and Deva/Surya during which Surya learns that Arjun's mother is his mother, too. Surya promises his mother that he will not harm Arjun but refuses to leave Deva, whose friendship is more valuable to him than any other relationship. Deva is stunned to learn that collector and Surya are brothers and admires Surya for not parting with him in spite of discovering his identity. During the process of surrendering to the collector, assuring him completely stopping their activities, Deva is shot to death by his enemy. Surya, in a fit of rage, brutally kills Kalivardhan (Amrish Puri) who was the cause for Deva's death and surrenders to the police after performing the final rites of his friend. But the police withdraw the case due to lack of evidence and witnesses. The collector goes to another place on a new posting accompanied by his wife. His mother then changes her mind to stay with her elder son, Surya.\n\nFor More Updates :\n\nSubscribe @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChrw2LBoXIAHXMspjCQOY0Q?sub_confirmation=1\nLike us @ https://www.facebook.com/CuppaMovies", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3JTjqha9mE0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3JTjqha9mE0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3JTjqha9mE0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3JTjqha9mE0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3JTjqha9mE0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Cuppa Movies", "tags": ["Dhalapathi Movie", "Dhalapathi Full Movie", "Dhalapathi Full Scenes", "Dhalapathi Scenes", "Dhalapathi Full Songs", "Dhalapathi Video Songs", "Dhalapathi Best Scenes", "Dhalapathi Comedy Scenes"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Dalapathi Telugu Full Movie - Rajinikanth, Mammootty, Arvind Swamy || Mani Ratnam - All Time Hit", "description": "Thalapathi (English: Commander) is a 1991 Indian Tamil crime-drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam and produced by G.
