Click on the link to explore the toys now! - https://amzn.to/2PCeSDS\n\nKids, you might think that all babies are as naughty and mischievous as you toddlers right? But, there is one sweet little preschooler who is not at all naughty, and has very good manners. His name is Jack Horner. Little Jack Horner is known to always sit in a  corner and eat his Christmas pie quietly. He loves it so much that he picks up small pieces of plum with his thumbs and relishes each of them. Jack Horner is a very good boy, and he knows it too! In fact, we think you kids can become excellent friends with Jack Horner, and hence we have this nursery rhyme for you kids that talks about Jack and his Christmas pie. Maybe next time, Jack can visit you kids during your preschool playtime and share some yummy pie with you all! Isn't it always nice to make new friends with whom you can sing your children rhymes and kids songs?

Before the papa went into the office, he scrutinizes everyone's homework and notes. But once the pap is out it's time to play, at least for Banu and Bablu. The same happened this day too. Banu and Bablu ran into the sister's room. Within a flash of a minute, everything became a mess. The globe is bouncing like a football, the books are flying and the Abacus is now a bunch of colored balls and wood pieces. The mom came and interfered with their play. She was furious and asks them to put everything back in order. Banu and Bablu agreed to organize everything and they had learned one important basic concept of Mathematics named classification.\n\n\u2605 Arrogance moral story\nOne morning Kathu the cute kitten woke up in an ugly mood. She started to quarrel from the bed. Mama came and serve the breakfast. It's tasty fish for today. The little brother started to irritate Kathu. He claimed that his share of breakfast is bigger. Kathu lost her temper and she started a fight. What happened next? Watch this story.\n\n\u2605 How honeybees make honey?\nOne day the cute puppy Pupi woke up by hearing the buzzing sound of a bee. He thought its a mosquito. Why this mosquito is bothering my sleep. Pupy was angry. But to his amusement, the bee started to speak. He introduced himself as a honey bee, not a mosquito. Pupi became curious and the honey bee taught him the whole story of a bees life.
