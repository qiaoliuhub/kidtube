Subscribe to Kiddopedia channel for more educational videos for kids \u2192 https://goo.gl/O1jdcO\n\nApes are primates. The main difference of apes to other primates such as monkeys is that they do not have a tail. The types of apes are the great apes and the lesser apes. Here are the five of great apes: gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, humans, and bonobos. Gibbons and siamangs belong to the family of lesser apes.\n\nIn this video, real videos of apes are shown to small children to teach the apes vocabulary. Several different great apes and lesser apes are presented with the native British English pronunciation of their name.
