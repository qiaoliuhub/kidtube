The motto is \"Learning while Playing...!\" We aim to make kids smart by developing fun educational methods so as to create a sense of confidence in them. We believe that a kid\u2019s first learning begins at home. Keeping our belief in mind, we would be presenting videos of the various activities, simply performed by the kiddos, at home.                                                                 \n KIDOVITY STAR NAME:- SHIVAM MANOJ KULKARNI\nACTIVITY NAME: SINGING"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT6M48S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "12", "likeCount": "3", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "kXtFp7pWtJKqs5eL0yTZaEnopMc", "id": "77nq2n4qplU", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-12-02T16:23:58Z", "channelId": "UCFsLEAbWprS7OHuGDLlP-DQ", "title": "Fantastic Mr. Fox - How to Draw Fantastic Mr Fox with Gertit and Teacher (Diy With Paper)", "description": "How to Draw Fantastic Mr. Fox with Gertit and Teacher (Diy With Paper) - Fantastic Mr Fox\nSUBSCRIBE to Gertit's Adventures: https://smarturl.it/GertitSubscribe\n\nEnjoy watching a video of making Fox puppet out of a toilet roll paper.\nOur mission is to sent some positive energy to you kids and give you some How To tips to make you also at home this kind of entertain toys for you kids. \nKids learning mission is to give more education staff for kids and also ways for parents to be creative with their kids on helping them doing new toys and have much funn.\n\nHope you will Enjoy this video, if YES, please LIKE and SHARE our video.\n\nThanks for Watching!\n\nDIY & Crafts for Kids videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI0lA199KYzu7_-8H8dkWYYdmVhvgeC-u", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/77nq2n4qplU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/77nq2n4qplU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/77nq2n4qplU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/77nq2n4qplU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/77nq2n4qplU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Gerti ToysReview", "tags": ["fantastic mr. fox", "fantastic mr fox", "how to make fantastic cartoon", "diy with paper", "mr fox cartoon", "diy cartoon fox", "diy cartoon character", "gertit", "diy with gertit", "how to make cartoon drawing", "diy with teacher", "how to draw", "do it yourself", "art ideas", "how to", "diy activities", "diy crafts cartoon", "art and craft", "gertit's adventures", "gertit daily vlog", "gertit toy", "art lesson", "gertit toysreview", "gertit toys review", "#gertit", "gertit toy review"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Fantastic Mr. Fox - How to Draw Fantastic Mr Fox with Gertit and Teacher (Diy With Paper)", "description": "How to Draw Fantastic Mr. Fox with Gertit and Teacher (Diy With Paper) - Fantastic Mr Fox\nSUBSCRIBE to Gertit's Adventures: https://smarturl.it/GertitSubscribe\n\nEnjoy watching a video of making Fox puppet out of a toilet roll paper.\nOur mission is to sent some positive energy to you kids and give you some How To tips to make you also at home this kind of entertain toys for you kids. \nKids learning mission is to give more education staff for kids and also ways for parents to be creative with their kids on helping them doing new toys and have much funn.\n\nHope you will Enjoy this video, if YES, please LIKE and SHARE our video.\n\nThanks for Watching!\n\nDIY & Crafts for Kids videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI0lA199KYzu7_-8H8dkWYYdmVhvgeC-u"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M22S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "26024", "likeCount": "46", "dislikeCount": "25", "favoriteCount": "0"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "o0RUpamt38NDTXuFbAlve7v-bvk", "id": "tcdtmvGv3T4", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-03-01T14:00:02Z", "channelId": "UCdn8RwLEdNPaxr40RJ58lCA", "title": "Young Children Learning to Ice Skate", "description": "Or, maybe not. 3 year old and 6 year old attempt skating for the first time.
