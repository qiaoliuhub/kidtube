She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.\n\nGeorge Pig\nGeorge is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019\n\nMummy Pig\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.\n\nDaddy Pig\nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses.\n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel! \n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\n#Peppa #PeppaPig #PeppaPigEnglishepisodes #PeppaPigEnglish #PeppaPigSongs #Nurseryrhymes #Kids \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.\nPeppa Pig created by Mark Baker and Neville Astley.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpUR1rHXbqs/default_live.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpUR1rHXbqs/mqdefault_live.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpUR1rHXbqs/hqdefault_live.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpUR1rHXbqs/sddefault_live.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpUR1rHXbqs/maxresdefault_live.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Peppa Pig - Official Channel", "tags": ["peppa pig", "peppa pig english episodes", "peppa", "peppa pig full episodes", "pepa pig", "peppa pig peppa pig", "peppa pig english", "peppa pig song", "pig", "pig peppa pig", "peppa pig cartoon", "papa pig", "peppa pig in english", "peppa pig live", "peppapig", "pepp", "pepapig", "peppa pig songs", "peppa pig live stream", "cartoon", "nursery rhymes", "nursery", "lullaby", "lullabies", "Peppa pig song", "songs for kids", "toddler songs", "toddler", "twinkle twinkle little star", "five little monkeys", "humpty dumpty", "abc", "alphabet song"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "live", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Peppa Pig Song \u2764\ufe0f LIVE \u2764\ufe0f Nursery Rhymes + Kids Songs", "description": "\ud83c\udfb5 More Peppa Pig Nursery Rhymes: http://bit.ly/PPNurseryRhymes\n\u2764\ufe0f More Peppa Pig Nursery Rhymes:http://bit.ly/PeppaNursery \n\n\u2606 Subscribe for more videos: http://bit.ly/PeppaPigYT  \n#Peppa #PeppaPig #PeppaPigEnglish \n\nSing and Dance with Peppa Pig - Nursery Rhymes:\n\ud83c\udfb5 Humpty Dumpty\n\ud83c\udfb6 Wheels On The Bus\n\ud83c\udfb5 Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\n\ud83c\udfb6 Peppa, Peppa, Yes Daddy!\n\ud83c\udfb5 If You're Spooky and You Know It\n\ud83c\udfb6 ABC Song / Alphabet Song\n\ud83c\udfb5 Five Little Monkeys\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\n\u2764\ufe0f  Watch the latest uploads here! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFEgnf4tmQe_L3xlmtFwX8Qm5czqwCcVi\n\u2764\ufe0f  Watch Peppa Pig's most Popular videos here!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFEgnf4tmQe8CuwieGKH2kfrXqWBB6A78\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nAbout Peppa Pig official channel:\n\nWelcome to the Official Peppa Pig channel and the home of Peppa on YouTube!
