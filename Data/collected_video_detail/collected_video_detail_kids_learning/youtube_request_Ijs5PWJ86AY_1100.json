After this chorus, there\u2019s more\n\nI am the Multiplication Table\nRemember me because you are able\nWe\u2019ll learn to multiply 1 through 10\nUp to 100 because you can\n\nWhen we start at the X\nAnd count diagonally down\nYou\u2019ll find the answer to each number multiplied by itself without a frown\n\nYou\u2019ll see 1 X 1 = 1 and here are some more \nThen you see 2 X 2 and it does equal 4\n\n3 X 3 = 9 and 4 X 4 is 16\n5 X 5 is 25 now you know what I mean\n\n6 X 6 = 36 and 7 X 7 is 49 \n8 X 8 = 64 I know you\u2019re feeling fine\n9 X 9 = 81. Yeah, that\u2019s what I said. \nAnd 10 X 10 = 100 you can see here in red\nYou can move across or down and \nAnd multiply each number on its own\nLet\u2019s try a couple out\nThen you can continue at home \nMultiplying by 1. Yeah, \nit is so easy \nYou always end up with the same number \nyou multiplied by you see\nFor example, 1 X 1 = 1 and 2 X 1 is 2\nAnd 3 X 1 = 3. Now you practice too\nLet\u2019s move to 2 and count straight across\n2 4 6 8 10 Start over if you\u2019re lost\n12 14 16 18 and 20\nLet\u2019s try one more row. Start at number 3 \n3 6 9 12 15 18\n21 24 27 and 30 \nDownload your time's table sheet from KLT\u2019s site\nAnd practice multiplying till you get it right \n\n#multiply #multiplication #educational #multiplicationsong #kids #multiplicationtable #KidsLearningTube", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6ajLh0isG8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6ajLh0isG8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6ajLh0isG8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6ajLh0isG8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6ajLh0isG8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Kids Learning Tube", "tags": ["Multiplication Song", "kids learning tube", "multiplication song all tables", "multiplication song", "multiplication table", "10 times table song for kids", "10 times table", "table song", "multiplication tables 2 to 10", "times table", "times tables songs", "times tables", "times tables songs 1-12", "multiplying", "multiplication", "multiplication mashup", "multiplication for kids", "math", "numbers for kids", "times", "kids", "math songs for kids", "math for kids", "math for", "math for kindergarten", "Math songs"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Multiplication Song for Kids/Times Table Song for Kids", "description": "Learn to multiply 1 through 10 with the multiplication table with this fun educational multiplication song for kids.

After this chorus, there\u2019s more\n\nI am the Multiplication Table\nRemember me because you are able\nWe\u2019ll learn to multiply 1 through 10\nUp to 100 because you can\n\nWhen we start at the X\nAnd count diagonally down\nYou\u2019ll find the answer to each number multiplied by itself without a frown\n\nYou\u2019ll see 1 X 1 = 1 and here are some more \nThen you see 2 X 2 and it does equal 4\n\n3 X 3 = 9 and 4 X 4 is 16\n5 X 5 is 25 now you know what I mean\n\n6 X 6 = 36 and 7 X 7 is 49 \n8 X 8 = 64 I know you\u2019re feeling fine\n9 X 9 = 81. Yeah, that\u2019s what I said. \nAnd 10 X 10 = 100 you can see here in red\nYou can move across or down and \nAnd multiply each number on its own\nLet\u2019s try a couple out\nThen you can continue at home \nMultiplying by 1. Yeah, \nit is so easy \nYou always end up with the same number \nyou multiplied by you see\nFor example, 1 X 1 = 1 and 2 X 1 is 2\nAnd 3 X 1 = 3. Now you practice too\nLet\u2019s move to 2 and count straight across\n2 4 6 8 10 Start over if you\u2019re lost\n12 14 16 18 and 20\nLet\u2019s try one more row.

And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that\u2019s called hibernation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nEvaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn\u2019t last.

Evaporation, evaporation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nGravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nMetamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don\u2019t know. Do you know why it happens?
