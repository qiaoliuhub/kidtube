Today I\u2019m going to share some of my child free spending habits that happen on a weekly basis. I live in Canada so keep that in mind when you watch as prices for things can be a bit more expensive than in the USA. While choosing the child free life allows for more flexibility in how we spend our money, we still follow a budget.\ud83d\ude0a This idea that child free couples just have endless amounts of money isn\u2019t really realistic for most people. Enjoy watching how a child free woman spends her money. Well, our money.

Today I\u2019m going to share some of my child free spending habits that happen on a weekly basis. I live in Canada so keep that in mind when you watch as prices for things can be a bit more expensive than in the USA. While choosing the child free life allows for more flexibility in how we spend our money, we still follow a budget.\ud83d\ude0a This idea that child free couples just have endless amounts of money isn\u2019t really realistic for most people. Enjoy watching how a child free woman spends her money. Well, our money.

It's also great to perform anytime you or your little ones need to take a short time out to calm down. This routine is all about deep breathing and is a great way to open up the spine and stretch the torso. \n\nIn this video I have tried to represent breathing in a new way by adding a blue ball in the bottom left hand corner. As the ball gets bigger, breathe in, as the ball gets smaller, breathe out. I hope it helps! As always, children will be able to grasp the movements and breathing patterns quicker if you perform the exercises with them.
