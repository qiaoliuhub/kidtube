Slow, deep breaths are one of the best ways to calm an anxious child.\n \nAn anxious or angry child is in flight-or-fight mode with their body primed to handle a perceived threat. This usually leads to fast, shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and tense muscles. Practicing slow, deep breathing tells your body that it can calm down, and as the physical arousal decreases, the emotional feeling of anxiety or anger will too.\n \nHere\u2019s a sample of how I talk to kids about deep breathing for relaxation:\n \n\u201cWhen we get scared or worried or angry, we usually take quick shallow breaths that stay at the top of our chest. (I put my hand on the top of my chest to give a focal point and demonstrate what this looks like.) When we want to calm down, we need to take slow belly breaths instead. Imagine that there is a balloon in your belly. When you breathe in, you want to push all the air down and fill up the balloon so that your belly puffs out. (I put my hand on my belly and demonstrate this.) Then, you breathe out slowly and your belly gets smaller as the balloon deflates.\u201d\n \nSometimes it\u2019s easier to practice belly breaths if you lay down. I\u2019ll have the child lay on the couch and we\u2019ll put a small stuffed animal (or balloon) on their stomach. I\u2019ll remind them that when they breathe in, the stuffed animal should rise, and when they breathe out, it should go down. We\u2019ll practice this until they seem to understand how to do the belly breaths.\n \nAfter they understand the belly breathing, I\u2019ll help them slow down the breathing like this:\n \n\u201cTo keep our breathing slow, we\u2019ll try to count to four as we breathe in and to four as we breathe out. Let\u2019s practice and do five slow breaths together; I\u2019ll count as we go. Try to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe out, purse your lips like you\u2019re blowing bubbles. Put one hand on your stomach to remind yourself to focus on filling up your belly when you breathe in. In \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4. Out \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4\u2026\u201d\n\nSubscribe to:\nFablefy.com\nfacebook.com/fablefy\ntwitter.com/fablefy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PcCmxEW5WA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PcCmxEW5WA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PcCmxEW5WA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PcCmxEW5WA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PcCmxEW5WA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Fablefy - The Whole Child", "tags": ["meditation", "mindful meditation", "belly breaths", "balloon breaths"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Two minutes Mindfulness: Balloon Breaths/Belly Breaths - Breathing exercise for Children", "description": "Balloon breathing is a simple breathing exercise that you can do anywhere. Slow, deep breaths are one of the best ways to calm an anxious child.\n \nAn anxious or angry child is in flight-or-fight mode with their body primed to handle a perceived threat. This usually leads to fast, shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and tense muscles. Practicing slow, deep breathing tells your body that it can calm down, and as the physical arousal decreases, the emotional feeling of anxiety or anger will too.\n \nHere\u2019s a sample of how I talk to kids about deep breathing for relaxation:\n \n\u201cWhen we get scared or worried or angry, we usually take quick shallow breaths that stay at the top of our chest. (I put my hand on the top of my chest to give a focal point and demonstrate what this looks like.) When we want to calm down, we need to take slow belly breaths instead. Imagine that there is a balloon in your belly. When you breathe in, you want to push all the air down and fill up the balloon so that your belly puffs out. (I put my hand on my belly and demonstrate this.) Then, you breathe out slowly and your belly gets smaller as the balloon deflates.\u201d\n \nSometimes it\u2019s easier to practice belly breaths if you lay down. I\u2019ll have the child lay on the couch and we\u2019ll put a small stuffed animal (or balloon) on their stomach. I\u2019ll remind them that when they breathe in, the stuffed animal should rise, and when they breathe out, it should go down. We\u2019ll practice this until they seem to understand how to do the belly breaths.\n \nAfter they understand the belly breathing, I\u2019ll help them slow down the breathing like this:\n \n\u201cTo keep our breathing slow, we\u2019ll try to count to four as we breathe in and to four as we breathe out. Let\u2019s practice and do five slow breaths together; I\u2019ll count as we go. Try to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe out, purse your lips like you\u2019re blowing bubbles. Put one hand on your stomach to remind yourself to focus on filling up your belly when you breathe in.

The structure of the fitness program is as follows:\n\nWork out hard for 20-30 seconds...\nRest for 10 seconds...\nREPEAT.\nComplete 8 rounds.\n\nYou push yourself as hard as you can for 20-30 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each fitness exercise. \n\nThis is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.\n\n______________________________________________\nGUIDED COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH           \n(Recovery Breathe mini lesson)\n______________________________________________\n\nRECOVERY/MINDFULNESS.       \n\"Hey everybody!
