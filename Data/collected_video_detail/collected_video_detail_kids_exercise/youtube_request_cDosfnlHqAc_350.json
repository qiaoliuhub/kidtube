Folks, especially parents, guardians and kids, intoeing is common in my practice and it really lead me to write up, plan, shoot and edit THIS VIDEO because as a parent myself, when you see your child or anyone in your social circle walk with their feet intoeing, you get a little bit concerned. \n\nIn this video, I will show you a simple workout that anyone from 1 year old to 1000 years old can do to help correct their intoeing and restore better equilibrium to their walking, running and jumping!    Let\u2019s gooo!\n\nAlrighty folks, thank you for watching my video and if you have any questions and comments, then please drop them in the comments below the video! And also, if you\u2019re finding the content relatable, enjoyable and insightful, then let\u2019s stay in touch by you punching that \u2018subscribe button\u2019 and tapping that \u2018bell button\u2019 to stay in the \u2018know\u2019 when new content arrives!\n\n\nDo you know why your child or you walk with intoeing? Or pigeon toes? 3 main reasons : metatarsus adductus, nternal tibial torsion   , increased femoral anteversion.\n\nFolks, this is not a WHY AND HOW VIDEO. There\u2019s plenty of it on Google and YouTube, however, I\u2019ll link an article I wrote a while ago that will go through Intoeing. \n\nThis video is about taking ACTION dammit! We need to take action to make change. \n1/ The first action I request you do is to watch and enjoy this video! Take notes if you need too! \n\n2/ The second action is to make an appointment with your local Podiatrist who specialises in children so that they can assess the extent of intoeing. The truth is, if the extent of intoeing is quite severe on imaging and physical assessments, surgery is a possibility. However, I understand that you may not want that or be comfortable with that. Go see your local Podiatrist. \n\n3/ The third action is to APPLY this simply exercise circuit for 15-20 minutes a day. If you\u2019re an adult, add this to your exercise workout, if you\u2019re a busy parent, then you have my permission to act like a kid and make this a fun and interactive workout with your children! Ok? It\u2019s spending quality time with your children.\n\nRemember the goal of this workout is strengthen hip and thigh muscles to encourage more hip outward rotation and reduce hip inward rotation! Thereby reducing intoeing! \n\n[SEND ME YOUR VIDEOS DOING THIS WORKOUT ON INSTAGRAM - TAG ME @THE_FOOT_MECHANIC WITH THE HASHTAG #FEETANDCO so i can have a look!]\n\nOk, so here is the program which I call the \u201cThe Penguin\u201d workout. \n\nTHE PENGUIN WORKOUT\n\n1/  Big Bear walks\n2/ Sumo Frog Jumps\n3/ Cheeky Crab Walks\n4/ Penguin Walks\n\nI want you and your kids to do each workout 5-10 reps [define reps] as a progressional circuit. They will repeat this circuit at least 3-4 times. \n\nI\u2019m going to demonstrate this workout! Firstly, prepare the training area - outdoor, grass, soft surface areas with markers to map out the course. The great thing is that your course can be straight or with turns whichever fits well with your home or outdoor area! Once set up, Then you can proceed. \n\n\nWhat did you think folks?! Hmm. i thought it was a pretty good video! Now folks, I\u2019d love for you to share you and your family\u2019s playtime doing The Penguin workout on my Instagram by tagging my Insta name  : @the_foot_mechanic and hashtag it with #feetandco!\n\nOk!
