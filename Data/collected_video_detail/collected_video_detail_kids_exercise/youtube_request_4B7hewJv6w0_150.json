All exercises in Dyseggxia have been scientifically designed to target reading and writing errors specific for Dyslexic children.\n\nThe exercises have been evaluated by a group of users with Dyslexia and are targeted to help improve difficulties caused by Dyslexia. To do so, we have combined current pedagogical strategies with the results of an analysis of real errors made by children.\n\nDyseggxia is divided into three levels: easy, medium and hard. These have been designed according to word frequency in texts, word length and the number of similar words.\n\nEach level contains several exercises from 5 types:\n\n- Insertion: a letter is missing in a word and must be inserted from the available answers\n- Omission: there is an extra letter in the word that must be deleted\n- Substitution: there is a wrong letter in the word that must be changed by one of the possible answers\n- Derivation: the user is presented with several possible endings to a word and must chose the correct option\n- Sentence separation: several words are put together, and the user must identify the breaking points between words\n\nDyseggxia now includes exercises both in Spanish and English!
