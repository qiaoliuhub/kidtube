She lives 250 miles from my house. Her parents were nice enough to allow me, a perfect stranger, to come in and share their daughter with the world. Thank you, again. My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist from the United States. I hope to follow Myla as she develops. I hope to teach ideas to help her learn to move, crawl, sit and walk. I started this video series after questions came in from all over the world from people seeking assistance in helping children with low tone. The ideas I teach in this video are not appropriate for a much weaker child than the one featured in this video. I hope you find this idea useful and simple. \n\nMy website is www.pediatricPTexercises.com  My Facebook page is Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises. My informational books, \"A is for Autism,\"  \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Hips\"  and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Knees\" are available on Amazon. \"A is for ADHD\" should be available shortly. Do not hesitate to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com with questions, concerns or favorable reviews! Please note I am unable to provide treatment recommendations for a child I have not personally evaluated.\n\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos. I have reviewed and corrected the closed captions for this video so that you might understand what I am saying even if you don't speak English. I hope the directions below are helpful to you. \nTo turn on Captions, click CC in the bottom right corner of the video\nTo choose a different caption language:\nAt the bottom right, click Settings.

If not, here is a review. Today we are going to be learning the 'simple step'--Kid 'N Play style. Just a review of the 'simple step'; it was just walking forwards and back.

It's just a basic step to warm you up to get the cardio going. Now, we are going to it Kid 'N Play style, so we are going to start to funk it up a little bit. \n\nYou are going to step forward on right, then your left, then your right, and then pick your left foot up and hit. Then back on your left, right, back--and then check this out--touch the floor. OK? If you can't touch the floor, go halfway down. \n\nLet's do that again, slow.\n\nRight foot. 1-2-3, pick the left foot up, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, TAP, or half way. \n\nOkay. One more time; slow. \n\n1-2-3- KICK, 1-2-3-DOWN .\n\nNow, I want you to take it up a notch, because the cardio is what you need to get going, so that you are burning calories, so that you are getting your sweat on, and you're not being lazy, right?!\n\nHere we go: Starting with the right foot, stepping forward we have: \n\n1-2-3-STEP, BACK 2-3-and DOWN, 1-2-, STEP-BACK 2-, and DOWN, 1-2, STEP-BACK 2-,and DOWN, 1-2-,HIT \n\nLast one; hold it here. \n\nHOLD.\n\nGood! OK? So as we noticed, we only were doing it to the right. OK, so let's take it to the left--slow to start--so that you are even, and you are not just doing it on one side. \n\nStep forward with your left foot. Yes?\n\n1-2-3- pick it up, and BACK- 2- 3-, and DOWN, \n\nAgain,\n\nLEFT, RIGHT, LEFT- pick it up, and RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, all the way. You can always go halfway if you need to\n\nNow we are going to try it up to speed starting with the left foot.\n\nReady, set, go. \n\nAnd 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2-3-DOWN, 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2--One more! 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2-3-HOLD.\n \nOkay! Good! So you can take that either side, starting with the right, starting with the left. It's up to you; just take a break in between. Give it a shot!
