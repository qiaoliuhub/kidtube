But it does not have to be only at gym class. It can be something fun too. Playing is not just fun but also keeps you physically active.\n\nBenefits of Exercise -\nThere are a lot of benefits from regular exercise. Kids who are active will:\n\n- have stronger\u00a0muscles and bones\n- be less likely to become\u00a0overweight\n- decrease the risk of developing\u00a0type 2 diabetes\n- lower\u00a0blood pressure\u00a0and blood cholesterol levels\n- have a better outlook on life\n\nBesides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, kids who are physically fit sleep better. They're also better able to handle physical and emotional challenges \u2014 from running to catch a bus to studying for a test.\n\nThe Three Elements of Fitness - \nThe three elements of fitness in action when kids play in the playground are:\n\n1. Endurance: When a child is chasing or being chased by another child at play.\n2. Strength: When a child crosses a monkey bar.\n3. Flexibility: Bending down to tie their shoes. \n\nRegular aerobic activity helps a child to build good endurance levels. Aerobic exercise causes the heart to beat faster and a person breathes harder. Regular aerobic activity strengthens the heart and improves the body's ability to deliver oxygen to all its cells.\n\nFollowing are some fun aerobic activities:\n\n- basketball\n- bicycling\n- ice skating\n- soccer\n- swimming\n- tennis\n- walking\n- jogging\n- running\n\nImproving strength doesn't have to be only from only lifting weights instead, kids can do push-ups, stomach crunches, pull-ups, and other exercises to help tone and strengthen muscles. They also improve their strength when they climb, do a handstand, or wrestle.\n\nStretching exercises helps a child improve\u00a0flexibility, allowing muscles and joints to bend and move easily through their full range of motion. Simplest activities like reaching out for a toy or practicing a split or doing a cartwheel are fun ways to stretch and build one\u2019s flexibility. \n\n#ExerciseRegularly #HealthTips #AskColey\n\nTo learn more about how regular exercise keeps you healthy, visit the best e-learning website here: https://mocomi.com/exercise-regularly/\n\nFor more fun learning health tips and good habits, visit: https://mocomi.com/learn/new-world/ask-coley/\n\nWatch more ask coley videos in one go here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrIPt0fi9vk&list=PL6vCwGtCTVtOEYlvjEu5c3SCN99aP12bh\n\nSubscribe here for new and interesting content every week \u25ba \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/mocomikids?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPress Bell Icon \ud83d\udd14; For Latest Updates. \nThanks for watching!

It is an inverted posture which provides many of the same benefits of the seated forward bend: the main physical benefit is to stretch the entire backside of the body from the head to the heels.\n\n1) To begin this posture, you should first come to Tadasana (Mountain Pose). Keep your hands on your hips and your feet either together or at the width of your hips. Breathe out and bend forward from the joints of your hips and not from the waist. As you come down, bring the front of your torso away from the groin area and open up the space between the sternum and the pubis. Just as it is with all forward bends, the importance is on elongating the front of the torso as you come into the position.\n2) Bend forward with your knees kept straight if you are able to. Keep your hands under your feet with the palms facing up and bring your toes to touch your wrist.\n3) While breathing in, straighten your arms and raise the front of the torso away from the thighs. At this point, your back should look concave. Remain in this position for a few breaths and then breathe out and stretch forward and down. Bend your elbows to the side so that they frame the head. Bring the shoulder blades down the back while maintaining some space between the ears and shoulders. Your weight should be distributed evenly through the feet. Raise your sitting bones upward to the ceiling. The top of your thighs should be turned inwards in bit.\n4) Each time you breathe in during the pose, you should stretch and lift the torso a little. Each time you breathe out, release a little more into the forward bend. Doing this will oscillate the torso in an imperceptible manner. Remain in this position for around 20 seconds.\n5) To get out of the posture, release the hands. Get your hands to your hips, breathe in and come back up with your back Straightened.\n\nYoga practices can make us more and more sensitive to subtle sensations in the body. Paying attention to and staying with finer sensations within the body is one of the surest ways to steady the wandering mind.

It is an inverted posture which provides many of the same benefits of the seated forward bend: the main physical benefit is to stretch the entire backside of the body from the head to the heels.\n\n1) To begin this posture, you should first come to Tadasana (Mountain Pose). Keep your hands on your hips and your feet either together or at the width of your hips. Breathe out and bend forward from the joints of your hips and not from the waist. As you come down, bring the front of your torso away from the groin area and open up the space between the sternum and the pubis. Just as it is with all forward bends, the importance is on elongating the front of the torso as you come into the position.\n2) Bend forward with your knees kept straight if you are able to. Keep your hands under your feet with the palms facing up and bring your toes to touch your wrist.\n3) While breathing in, straighten your arms and raise the front of the torso away from the thighs. At this point, your back should look concave. Remain in this position for a few breaths and then breathe out and stretch forward and down. Bend your elbows to the side so that they frame the head. Bring the shoulder blades down the back while maintaining some space between the ears and shoulders. Your weight should be distributed evenly through the feet. Raise your sitting bones upward to the ceiling. The top of your thighs should be turned inwards in bit.\n4) Each time you breathe in during the pose, you should stretch and lift the torso a little. Each time you breathe out, release a little more into the forward bend. Doing this will oscillate the torso in an imperceptible manner. Remain in this position for around 20 seconds.\n5) To get out of the posture, release the hands. Get your hands to your hips, breathe in and come back up with your back Straightened.\n\nYoga practices can make us more and more sensitive to subtle sensations in the body.
