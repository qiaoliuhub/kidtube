They are spending most of their time at home. This is a beautiful opportunity in many ways for families to connect and enjoy time together. It can also be a challenge as children are full of emotions and have limited resources to deal with the feelings coming up. Through this video I hope kids can try some fun yoga postures, get creative, and release any built up energy or stress. From playing with the letters that spell home, h-o-m-e, to talking about resources we can use when difficult emotions come up, this video is a chance to play and be silly together!

They are spending most of their time at home. This is a beautiful opportunity in many ways for families to connect and enjoy time together. It can also be a challenge as children are full of emotions and have limited resources to deal with the feelings coming up. Through this video I hope kids can try some fun yoga postures, get creative, and release any built up energy or stress.
