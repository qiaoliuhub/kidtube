I\u2019m so scared\nWe hide all and then we all wait\n\nThere it was again\nI need to go and check\nLet\u2019s be brave, let\u2019s find out \nPhew, just a bush outside\n\nOh I am so scared\nLet\u2019s stay here and wait\nNo, no go, stay with us\nit\u2019s so scary out there\n\nThere it was again\nWhat\u2019s behind that door?\nJust a toy car/ shining at night \nNo need to be afraid\n\nSomething just moved!\nIt\u2019s getting closer to us\nit\u2019s so scary, I\u2019m so scared\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not in my head\n\nWhat was that noise?\nLooks like a branch to me\nIt\u2019s not a monster, just a tree\nNo need to be afraid\n\nListen to Other Little Angel Songs:\n\nWe Fix the Car Together Daddy \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sqyql0Dz4s&t=145s\nHot and Cold On The Beach \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxpyuc6F_94\nDaddy is My Hero \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXeslZ8gG1o\nPoliceman vs Fireman \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4leGveePcPU\nWheels on the Ambulance \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUd7-264LUg\nWash Your Hands \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBZJp2viTTw\n\n\nThese rhymes for children help teach basic skills and improves their ability to comprehend and follow directions.
