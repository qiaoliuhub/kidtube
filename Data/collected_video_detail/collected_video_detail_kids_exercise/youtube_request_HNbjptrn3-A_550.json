Read Doctor Jo\u2019s blog post about this video at http://www.askdoctorjo.com/content/balance-coordination\n\nThis video will show you balance and coordination exercises while you are moving. So you might want to get near something to hold onto for balance. You can also use your cane if you need to.\n\nThe first exercise is going to be like you are walking on a tight rope. We call this tandem gait. You might call it the drunk test. Put one foot right in front of the other. Try to look straight ahead if you can. If that is too difficult, you can put them close together, but not right in front of the other. If this becomes easy to do, then you can move your head from side to side, or even up and down while you are walking.\n\nThe next movement is going to be the Grapevine or Crossovers. You will start off going sideways. Take the outside foot and cross it over the other foot. Then step out moving in one direction. Now take the outside foot and go behind the other one. It will almost look like you are braiding your feet. If this becomes easy to do, then you can move your head from side to side, or even up and down while you are walking.\n\nNow you are going to walk up on your toes. Try to stay up the whole time keeping your heels off the ground. Then change it to walking on your heels with your toes in the air. This one is actually a little harder so make sure you have something sturdy to hold onto if needed.\n\nRelated Videos:\n\nImprove Your Balance with Simple Exercises:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc62Ju2kUAc\n\nAnkle Strengthening Exercises & Stretches:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-iXYapbuqk\n\n===========================================\n\nClick Below to SUBSCRIBE for More Videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=askdoctorjo\n\n=======================================\n\nDoctor Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\nhttp://www.AskDoctorJo.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/AskDoctorJo\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/AskDoctorJo\n\n=======================================\n\nBalance & Coordination Exercises:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNbjptrn3-A\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and any related comments are not medical advice.

She lives 250 miles from my house. Her parents were nice enough to allow me, a perfect stranger, to come in and share their daughter with the world. Thank you, again. My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist from the United States. I hope to follow Myla as she develops. I hope to teach ideas to help her learn to move, crawl, sit and walk. I started this video series after questions came in from all over the world from people seeking assistance in helping children with low tone. The ideas I teach in this video are not appropriate for a much weaker child than the one featured in this video. I hope you find this idea useful and simple. \n\nMy website is www.pediatricPTexercises.com  My Facebook page is Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises.

This video by the What? Why? Children in Hospital charity shows mums, dads and children what happens in hospital. Having to wear a face mask, electrodes and getting their blood pressure measured during a test on an exercise bike can make children anxious. This video will help families prepare for the test. Parents could show this video to their child before their appointment to help them understand what is going to happen in hospital.\n\nPlease become a patron to our charity so we can make more videos:\nwww.patreon.com/wwcih\nmydonate.bt.com/charities/whatwhychildreninhospital\n\nMore info about our charity:\nwww.wwcih.org.uk"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT7M7S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "364234", "likeCount": "1527", "dislikeCount": "153", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/019_rr", "/m/0kt51", "/m/019_rr", "/m/0kt51"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "yHZydrLxE2BS87B14V3smK_LxX0", "id": "1RPfCzd1h_I", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-20T14:23:19Z", "channelId": "UCuEgW3r4ytXwd9UfQySv_Nw", "title": "The ABCs of Back to School Town Hall part 2", "description": "Rosita shows off her great home learning set-up, and educational experts weigh in on how kids can get the best education wherever they may be.\n\nSesame Street in Communities brings free video content of everyone's favorite, furry Muppet friends as they help children and the adults in their lives reach their highest potential.
