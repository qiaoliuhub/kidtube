(Envy of exercise)\n\nThese rules are very important for the proper operation of the simulator and immediate load. The omission of any stage is a loss of efficiency and quality of work.\n\nStart your workouts correctly and the results will not keep you waiting !!!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/my_first_evnik/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "ru"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M33S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "7003", "likeCount": "113", "dislikeCount": "8", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "12"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/019_rr", "/m/0kt51", "/m/019_rr", "/m/0kt51"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "YXAx_1zDTLIviRPHW0spPdfRu6E", "id": "b233g2pKyyM", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-01-16T17:17:28Z", "channelId": "UCu06KfIMeufTTan5euC7Kow", "title": "Kids workout", "description": "", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b233g2pKyyM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b233g2pKyyM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b233g2pKyyM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b233g2pKyyM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b233g2pKyyM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Christian Escalante", "tags": ["kidsfitness", "workout", "exercise", "pushups", "squats", "run", "abs"], "categoryId": "23", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Kids workout", "description": ""}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M24S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "74", "likeCount": "0", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/027x7n"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "MwLdSktDm8M_Pas-oDW4aBx03KA", "id": "fiqhfaPFPUc", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-18T02:00:03Z", "channelId": "UCmTe0LsfEbpkDpgrxKAWbRA", "title": "12 Minute Power Walk At Home Workout- Workout In A Mirror", "description": "12 Minute Power Walk At Home Workout\n\nYoutube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/physicaltherapyvideo\nWebsite: https://bobandbrad.com/\n\nThis video is part of a series called, Workout In A Mirror.

can get better.\n\u201cI like people coaching me,\u201d Damone says. \u201cI like getting coached.\u201d\nWhen he isn\u2019t playing sports, Damone says he likes to get lost in a book.\n\u201cI like reading books, especially the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books,\u201d he says.\nThe perfect forever family for Damone would include a mother and a father to serve as a strong male role model.\n\u201cLike any athlete,\u201d Hicks says. \u201cDamone needs a good coach and a good cheerleader.\u201d\n\nFor more information on children eligible for adoption, call Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK) at

Avocado\nAvocados and healthy eating go hand in hand. You can put them in your salad, sandwich or use it as a dip. This fruit, yes fruit, is packed with several of the brain's most valuable nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E and copper. Having it fresh each day will improve your problem solving skills and memory.\n\n2. Blueberries\nBlueberries make everything better! From smoothies to chocolates, Blueberries have been around for a long time. Not only are these tiny berries delicious, they\u2019re packed with brain boosting nutrients as well! Scientists have found they have the capacity to increase brain activity, boost blood flow and improve your memory.\n\n3. Turmeric\nThis ancient Indian herb\u2019s medical usage dates back centuries. Turmeric not only gives curry its yellow color, it\u2019s loaded with compounds and minerals that have anti inflammatory properties along with being one of the best foods for the brain. The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has a high concentration of antioxidants that boosts brain power and keeps cells healthy. \n\n4. Fatty Fish\nWhen was the last time you had fish for dinner? When we talk about Brain boosting foods, fatty fish tops the list. Fishes like trout, salmon and sardines fall under this category. What makes them special is the natural presence of essential Omega 3 fatty acids along with good fats. This combination helps in keeping your brain and heart healthy.\n\n5. Nuts And Seeds\nIf you haven\u2019t already added nuts and seeds to your meals then it is time for you to do so. Walnuts, almonds, peanuts, pecans and pistachios are filled with good fats, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. These help in preventing age related disease in the brain, protecting the cells and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. \n\nFor more information, please watch the video until the very end.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe to Bestie : https://goo.gl/tUqro6\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMedical Disclaimer: https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfWfcutlWWc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfWfcutlWWc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfWfcutlWWc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfWfcutlWWc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfWfcutlWWc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Bestie", "tags": ["Bestie", "Bestie Videos", "Bestie Health", "Bestie Food & Nutrition", "Brain Superfoods", "Superfoods", "Brain foods", "Brain diet", "Brain", "Avocado", "Blueberry", "Turmeric", "Orange", "Egg", "Broccoli", "Top 10 Superfoods For Your Brain", "foods to boost brain power", "brain power", "brain boosting", "brain boosting foods", "brain foods for brain health", "brain foods for brain power"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Top 10 Superfoods For Your Brain", "description": "Are blueberries on the list?
