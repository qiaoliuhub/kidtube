My clinic, Child and Family Development,  in Charlotte, NC, allowed me to use their facilities and their equipment to showcase Sebastian's skill and charming personality. We review techniques to reduce stiffness, encourage strength and control. I think you'll love spending time with him. Thank you to this family and my clinic for allowing this to happen.\n I also have available 3 children's educational books, \"A is for Autism,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\"   and now 2 professional books \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Hips\", and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Knees\" available on Amazon.  I have forthcoming \"A is for ADHD\" as well.  If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com. Please note: I am unable to provide treatment suggestions for a child I have not personally evaluated.\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos.
