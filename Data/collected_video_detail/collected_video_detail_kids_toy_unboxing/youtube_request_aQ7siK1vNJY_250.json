I wish I had one of these when I was a little girl! This drawing board is for 3year s old all the way up to 10 years old!

She normally gets bored of a new toy in less than a day but this toy she just can\u2019t put down! Tiffany loves to color but I have to admit that she gets too crazy with the crayons, she either ends up breaking them or miss the paper completely and get it all over the table. I don\u2019t know why but it NEVER crossed my mind to get one of these magnetic boards, it definitely would of made my life much easier! As a former preschool teacher I know how important it is to have your work tie their hands. This drawing board is great to encourage fine motor skills in your childs development. It is also a great way to encourage creativity and help children to learn how to express themselves visually.

It shows me playing with the HEXBUG Nano V2 Robot Bug it came with along with my other HEXBUG Nano Nitro Robot Bug Set.\n\nI show different numbers of the HEXBUGS in action. This is an essential part of all of the Kids Toys Reviews & Unboxings I do. My favorite part was when I showed 5 of the HEX BUGS Toys running around inside the playset at the same time with HEXBUG Nano Nitro Racetrack pieces with HEXBUG Nano Habitat Bridges. The kits I used to build the extra part were the were with the HEXBUG Habitat Nano Curved Bridges and HEXBUG Habitat Nano Straight Bridges.\n\nHere are the pros & cons for this HEXBUG Nano V2 Neon Infinity Loop HEXBUG Set:\n\nPros:\n- Easy to use\n- A fun toy to play with for 3+\n- Can be used to help expand other sets\n- It keeps the HEXBUGS from running all over the place\n- HEXBUGS make good Toys For Boys and good Toys For Girls\n- Assembly is very easy with a little help from your parents\n- The kit allows for flexibility to drive traffic in different ways\n- It can grow with you as you buy new kits or add new HEXBUG Nano Habitat pieces to your collection \n\nCon:\n- The HEXBUG Nano Nitro Bugs got clogged up and fell off the track, though the V2 HEXBUGS did better on this set\n\nIf you liked this video featuring these Robot Bug Toys, please hit that subscribe button and click on the bell to make sure you don't miss a single Uncle Ryan's Toy Review. \n\nSome of the videos I have done so far include Nerf Gun Reviews, Noise Putty, Magnetic Putty, and HEXBUG Toys.\n\nThe Nerf Blaster Reviews completed so far are for the Nerf Negotiator, Nerf Jolt, Nerf Quadrant with Accustrike Darts, Nerf NanFire, and many more to follow.\n\nI also did reviews for Flarp Noise Putty & Magnetic Putty I got from Banggood.com.
