These kinds of toy sets which use plasticine are always a great hit, as most kids really like to use play dough, considering it is absolutely great for developing creativity and imagination. The contents of this modeling clay for children, it seems, is a secret well kept, although we can tell that this is a dough for modeling various figures and characters as well as a sundry of objects, and contains both water and salt, as well as flour and wheat. We also need to say that this putty for playing has no peanuts or dairy products and that these kinds of toy sets are non-toxic, non-allergenic, and do not produce any irritation. It is also a great advantage that this dough can be used time and time again. And last but not least, it is definitely not a foodstuff!\n\nAnd what is this play set about? It features Stitch from the Lilo and Stitch franchise films. Stitch is a so-called genetic experiment, an alien who looks like a blue koala bear. This is a character which is liked by no one expect for Lilo, who refers to him as a dog. In fact, he has superhuman strength and a very high IQ but he behaves like a child. This play set includes 5 boxes of Play Dough surprises. The first box with blue plasticine features the figure of Stitch with a wobbly head eating a cupcake. The next one, with red play dough, is Stitch sitting on a doughnut. The third, in yellow play dough, is the figure of Stitch with an ice cream cone in his hand. The fourth box contains blue play clay and a figure of Stitch and a mug of cocoa. And the penultimate box contains burnt orange clay with Stitch eating candy. And last but in no way least, the purple Play Doh, after being taken off, will display Stitch eating cake.\n\n\u2605 \u266a \u2606 Watch More Videos \u2606 \u266a \u2605\n\nGIANT Play Doh Surprise Eggs Opening Toys Videos - Gigante Huevo Sorpresa de Juguetes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLokLhU83Xf9RAawI20BP2jSWloY1RTbqu\n\nORBEEZ GIANT EGG Play Doh Surprise Opening 50 + Surprise Toys Video Gigante Huevo Sorpresa\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8tEOUvSHxY\n\nDisney Pixar Inside Out Toys Play Doh Orbeez Giant Surprise Egg Sadness Joy Fear Disgust Anger Toy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msEOQ_fCE3U\n\nPlay Doh Minions Makin' Mayhem Set Despicable Me Toys \u2605 Juguetes de Los Minions Playdough Videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nB3CgH2ze8\n\nPlay Doh Minions Stamp & Roll Toy Review Featuring Despicable Me \u2605 Corrida de Minions by Hasbro Toys\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkrl3OcIoSg\n\nPlay Doh DohVinci Anywhere Art Studio Playset For Kids Worldwide From Hasbro Toys\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVors9or_0g\n\nPlay Doh My Little Pony Rainbow Dash Style Salon Playset 2015 MLP PlayDough Salon Toy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKYxM3xjRwI\n\nMasha i Medved \u2605 Masha And The Bear Giant Surprise Egg Opening Play Doh For Kids Worldwide\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajUhDbkf8pk\n\nPlay Doh Food Desserts Cookie Creations Surprise Toys Unboxing Playdough Videos For Children\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF8ASP_TnUY\n\nPAW Patrol Play Doh Surprise Toys Ryder Marshall Rubble Rocky Skye Chase \u2605 Juguetes Patrulla Canina\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rb7e5m6s6k\n\nThomas and Friends Play Doh Surprise Trains Toys Opening Thomas the Tank Engine Percy Gordon Toby\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP7nmwrmhNg\n\nPlay Doh Surprise Birthday Presents Unboxing Toys Video For Children Plastilina Regalos de Cumplea\u00f1o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gylEh6So3Nk\n\nLearn Names of Fruits & Vegetables In English For Children Play Doh and Microwave Oven Toy Videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CzjP4IWeMw\n\nPlaydough Videos For Children Play Doh Creative Playset Toys Learn Names of Animals With Play-doh\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4ZqxZnl4ws\n\n\u2764 Follow Us On Twitter & Google + \u2764\n\nGoogle + \u25ba https://plus.google.com/+ForKidsWorldwidePlus\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/Kids__Worldwide\n\n\u2605 \u266a Music By \u266a \u2605\n\nThanks to : Kevin MacLeod\n(incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\u2606 \u2605 \u266a \u2764 Thank you for watching our videos \u2764 \u266a \u2605 \u2606\n\n\u2606 \u2605 https://www.youtube.com/c/ForKidsWorldwidePlus \u2606 \u2605", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PPfYnTVeKc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PPfYnTVeKc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PPfYnTVeKc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PPfYnTVeKc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PPfYnTVeKc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Toys For Kids Worldwide", "tags": ["Play Doh", "Play Doh Surprise", "Play Doh Toys", "Play Doh Ice Cream", "Surprise Toys", "Surprise", "Unboxing", "Disney", "Disney Toys", "Ice Cream", "Cupcake", "Cake", "Cocoa", "Candy", "Doughnut", "Plasticine", "Plastilina", "Kids Toys", "Toys", "Toy", "Toy Videos", "Toys Video", "Toys For Kids Worldwide", "For Kids Worldwide", "Playdough", "Play-doh", "Playing", "Stitch", "Stitch Toys", "Lilo & Stitch", "lilo and stitch play doh", "Review", "Collection", "Juguetes", "Disney Stitch", "playdough videos for children", "playdough videos"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Play Doh Surprise Unboxing Disney Stitch Toys Ice Cream Cupcake Cake Cocoa Candy Doughnut", "description": "Toys For Kids Worldwide presents : Play Doh Surprise Unboxing Disney Stitch Toys Ice Cream Cupcake Cake Cocoa Candy Doughnut!\n\n\u2606 \u2605 \u266a \u2764 SUBSCRIBE \u2764 \u266a \u2605 \u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ForKidsWorldwidePlus?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2764 Description \u2764\n\nOnce more, we have Play Doh featured in a play set!

Easy Snap Design for ages 3 and up. Beads are connected by insert. It is simple and convenient to disassemble and assemble. These beads are made from Recycled Toys Perfect for parties, rainy days, or just having fun at the house, you can be with this fully reusable jewelry kit. Make it, wear it, remake it, and wear it again. BPA Free, The toy beads are sturdy and well-made, it is non-toxic. Best gift for girls beading and jewelry making,also a good idea for birthday and Chritsmas gift.\nReview by Davna (mom)- Once I received this DIY jewelry making kit I first looked at the packaging and I really like that it came in a plastic jar container that is really easy to open and close for Tiffany. The beads themselves are actually very well made, the quality  feels like beads that you would find at the Lakeshore Learning Store (except for HALF the price!) I love that the beads come in different textures, sizes and vibrant colors. It comes with a little booklet with pictures of some of the jewelry you can create which Tiffany liked to look at and recreated some of those accessories. The main thing I love about this toy is that it actually keeps both my girls entertained for LONG periods of time and it allows for their creativity to shine. We also use these to do some math, count and even create patterns! This is NOT meant for children under 3 as there are many small chocking hazard pieces BUT my youngest enjoys playing with them too under my CAREFUL supervision. It has been over a week now since we received this toy and since then both my girls have been playing with them DAILY! I highly recommend! \nCONS- The only con I found about this product is that some beads are harder to connect than others. Tiffany will be playing and be so nice and focused but then will have to come to me from time to time to help her snap some beads together which disrupts her (working) playtime. Tiffany is 4 years old so I know as she gets bigger she will be stronger and it will be easier for her to do completely on her own but if you have a 3 year old you will most likely have to play with them to help. My two year old already figured out which beads are harder to connect so she makes sure to only play with the beads that are easier to use lol \nSing King Karaoke https://youtu.be/dJgRhxg55fg\nNCS https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSoundsAxol x Alex Skrindo - You [NCS Release] Axol https://soundcloud.com/axol_music Alex Skrindo https://soundcloud.com/alex-skrindo\nTiffany Taylor LOVES toys,juguetes, \u0916\u093f\u0932\u094c\u0928\u0947, brinquedos, jouets, Spielzeug, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435, \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628, igra\u010dke, \u0111\u1ed3 ch\u01a1i, oyuncaklar, leksaker, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, juc\u0103rii, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043e\u043c, leker, \u0627\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc, zabawki, \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10, \u30c8\u30a4\u30ba, giocattoli, mainan, j\u00e1t\u00e9kok, \u05e6\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd, Hra\u010dky, leget\u00f8j, speelgoed, laruan, \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628, igra\u010dke, \u0111\u1ed3 ch\u01a1i, oyuncaklar, leksaker, juguetes, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, juc\u0103rii, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043e, \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1, Tiffany TAylor Kid Adventures LOVES them so so much!

Best gift for girls beading and jewelry making,also a good idea for birthday and Chritsmas gift.\nReview by Davna (mom)- Once I received this DIY jewelry making kit I first looked at the packaging and I really like that it came in a plastic jar container that is really easy to open and close for Tiffany. The beads themselves are actually very well made, the quality  feels like beads that you would find at the Lakeshore Learning Store (except for HALF the price!) I love that the beads come in different textures, sizes and vibrant colors. It comes with a little booklet with pictures of some of the jewelry you can create which Tiffany liked to look at and recreated some of those accessories. The main thing I love about this toy is that it actually keeps both my girls entertained for LONG periods of time and it allows for their creativity to shine. We also use these to do some math, count and even create patterns! This is NOT meant for children under 3 as there are many small chocking hazard pieces BUT my youngest enjoys playing with them too under my CAREFUL supervision. It has been over a week now since we received this toy and since then both my girls have been playing with them DAILY! I highly recommend! \nCONS- The only con I found about this product is that some beads are harder to connect than others. Tiffany will be playing and be so nice and focused but then will have to come to me from time to time to help her snap some beads together which disrupts her (working) playtime. Tiffany is 4 years old so I know as she gets bigger she will be stronger and it will be easier for her to do completely on her own but if you have a 3 year old you will most likely have to play with them to help.
