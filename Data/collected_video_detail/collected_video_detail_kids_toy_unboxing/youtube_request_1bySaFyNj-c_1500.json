Sometimes this may be simply to ensure that a particular object is in the correct place. At other times it can be several minutes arranging props or making a piece of apparatus. Often the preparation takes longer than the trick itself! Never let anyone see you doing this preparation or you will give away the secret.

She has donned her lab coat, and her thinking cap as she learns step by step the processes that go into planting a seed, making it sprout and nurturing it into a fully grown plant.\n\nWhat is more, now that Kyra knows how important different types of soil are she is also closely observing all the different muds of India wherever she goes, which means a lot more dirt on her hands and shoes! But her parents don't mind so much. She is getting closer to nature after all.  \n\nThe Garden Sciencz kit contains 20 different experiments in growing plants, soil samples, and different types of seeds of food crops like wheat, coriander, mustard, fenugreek and many more.

Jenny, Adley and Niko Bear found some awesome bats that go perfect for the holiday and decide to hang them on the door. Adley, being the loving little girl that she is, groups them in families and names them after all of us. \n\nOnce the door is all decorated, the find me downstairs so they can show me the great job that they did. After decorations, Adley comes up with a brand new game called statue! the rules are easy, Adley and Niko are statues, Jenny sells them, and I buy them. But they are crazy. The Adley statue moves around when I'm not looking while the Niko Bear statue has a button to make it come a live and run around the room. haha I love pretend play with the kiddos!!\n\nWith the new game done, I have to show you guys a new trick that the kiddos and I learned. We can hang from the ceiling in the kitchen!! It's hilarious, though Jenny wishes we didn't use the house like a park toy. We then head to the backyard splash pad to find some rocks for arts and crafts time.\n\nWe love doing little DIY creative projects with the kiddos, but these are extra special, because we are going to take these rocks to the construction site of a brand new LDS Temple. These temples are super important to us, so its awesome that we get to put little memories into the foundation. Adley draws pretty flowers, Niko colors his rock so good, and Jenny makes a cute rock for her and baby Navey and I make a rock about our family and how much we love each other. ( Also with a little pirate theme for pirate island lol)\n\nAfter dropping of the rocks and doing some work at the lake lot, I'm home for the night! I also brought gifts for the whole family. We have A for Adley shirts again!! We have a brand new company making them and they look so good. The colors are bright, the images look great, and we are excited to share them with you guys again!! Prices are still the same, we want them to be easy for you to get. If you bought a shirt before and there were problems with it, we want to help.
