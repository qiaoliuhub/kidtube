Imagine the feisty Autobot amigo charging into battle or grooving to the beat right in your living room. Autobot Sqweeks is the smallest among his fellow bots, but his spark shines just as bright. He\u2019s not one for a lot of words, but prefers to speak with action. Despite being in disrepair, he perseveres, and holds his loyalty to helping all living beings as his primary motivation. This tiny bot is the embodiment of 'more than meets the eye.'\n\n\nSubscribe Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23U4jpP2BAw8uxaH4Zwh8g?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/supersorrell/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/supersorrell/\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@supersorrell\nMy Website: https://www.supersorrell.com/\n\n\nMrs SuperSorrell On Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Mrs-SuperSorrell-111450687307873/\n\n\nAffiliate Links; \nAmazon - https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/supersorrell\nForbidden Planet https://forbiddenplanet.com/catalog/?affid=63190&page=1\n\n\nZbox Referral - https://www.zavvi.com/referrals.list?applyCode=ASH-R3P&li\nFortnite Creator Code  - \"IAMSUPERSORRELL\"\n\n\nAbout Channel: \nNEW CONTENT DAILY!! - ACTION FIGURE REVIEWS, Collectibles Reviews,  Shopping Vlogs, toy hunts, shopping haul, Collectible News videos! and so much more! we focus on collecting Marvel Legends, Star Wars Black Series, DC Multiverse, NECA Figures, Disney ToyBox, Disney Classic Toys & so much more!! \n\n\n#TransformersTheLastKnight #Transformers #Transformers5 #sqweeks #hasbro #toys #unboxing #review #autobots #TheLastKnight #robot #Robotics"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M16S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "44339", "likeCount": "260", "dislikeCount": "34", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "90"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "xx8Tdb-u_WsoqCAItEgBV_U1Oi4", "id": "N9tuxgafQYE", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-12-17T08:32:47Z", "channelId": "UCG_Wsfo9rnuh6famk23bitg", "title": "Rechargeable Green Laser Pointer 303 10000mw Review & Unboxing in Urdu/Hindi | Burning Laser Pointer", "description": "Hello Dear Viewers am back with a new video \n\nTopic of the Video  (Best Laser Light 2019 for presentation) \nRechargeable Green Laser Pointer 303 10000mw Review & Unboxing in Urdu/Hindi | Burning Laser Pointer Laser Light \namazing laser light 4 km range\n\nProduct Description\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n1)Laser Pen Can burn Low ignition point things,like Black Match\n\n2) Light can reach 8000 meters\n\n3) For first Using.be sure battery is full charged\n\nAnd Key Features\n532nm\n1000mw\nAdjustable laser pointer\nVisible beam\nLaser Color: Green\nOutput mode:Constant Wave\nPower supply:AAA Batteries x2 (Not Included AAA Batteries)\nDimension:\u03c614\u00d7160mm\nTechnical Parameter:Fixed focus, dot facula, continuous output\nGreen laser Output Wavelength: 532 nm\nOutput Power:5mw\nWorking Voltage:DC=3.0V\nTrigger Voltage:DC=2.8V\n\n5) 18650 battery, large capacity, easy to buy, renewal duration;\n6)The aviation aluminum alloy manufacture, strong and durable;\n7)The built-in laser module to improve the heat sink, circuit boards gathering protection design   \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Majid Tv Kids Toys unboxing & Reviews  YouTube channel!!
