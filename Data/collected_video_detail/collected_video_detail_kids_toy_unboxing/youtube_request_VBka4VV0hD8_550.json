Former park manager Claire Dearing creates a dinosaur rescue organization and teams up with Benjamin Lockwood, the former partner of John Hammond, to bring the creatures to a sanctuary in America. Claire's boyfriend Owen Grady, a former dinosaur trainer at the park, joins the mission to locate Blue,[7] the last of the Velociraptors that he trained.  However, a greater scheme emerges when the creatures are being auctioned away, and disaster strikes when a dangerous hybrid dinosaur, the Indoraptor, escapes and begins terrorizing people.\n\n=========================================\n\nA toy review by Keith's Toy Box, a magical bottomless toy box that reveals a new surprise toy everyday!

Former park manager Claire Dearing creates a dinosaur rescue organization and teams up with Benjamin Lockwood, the former partner of John Hammond, to bring the creatures to a sanctuary in America. Claire's boyfriend Owen Grady, a former dinosaur trainer at the park, joins the mission to locate Blue,[7] the last of the Velociraptors that he trained.  However, a greater scheme emerges when the creatures are being auctioned away, and disaster strikes when a dangerous hybrid dinosaur, the Indoraptor, escapes and begins terrorizing people.\n\n=========================================\n\nA toy review by Keith's Toy Box, a magical bottomless toy box that reveals a new surprise toy everyday!

Five Nights at Freddy's Toys for kids are super fun!  You will love this FNAF 5 Inch Articulated Funko toy unboxing with FNAF stop motion! The Five Nights at Freddy's toys are supposed to stay on the shelf, but they come to live, eat all of the dogs food, and then run away! Jazzy Puppet screams when the Five Nights at Freddy's Jumpscares happen! They are funny FNAF jumpscares though! Non of the FNAF Jump Scares are not scary. You will laugh at this funny Five Night's at Freddys Halloween Video for kids! Jazzy meets some really fun FNAF Toys! She Meets Freddy Fazbear, Toy Chika, Toy Bonnie, and Foxy! They come to live and are so funny! This is a FNAF not scary video for children to enjoy. The four Five Nights at Freddy's action figures are so cool! My favorite is the Toy Chica FNAF action figure, and I love FNAF videos! These are similar to FNAF Mcfarlane toys and come from the FNAF world! You will love this family friendly video. It is a super fun family friendly toy review for kids that is perfect for Halloween! Thank you for visiting the Jazzy Puppet Show! \nHere are the toys that she is Unboxing and doing a Toy Review on: \nFreddy Fazbear, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, Toy Chika, and Toy Foxy. This set is like the FNAF Funko toys! The FNAF toy set also came with a Golden Freddy Fazbear, but the Freddy bear didn't make it into the FNAF kid's video!
