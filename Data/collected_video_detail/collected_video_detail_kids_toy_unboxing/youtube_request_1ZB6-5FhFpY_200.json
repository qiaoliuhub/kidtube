Today is a SUPER long squishy unboxing video because I am opening 50 packages! I know it\u2019s a LOT and this video goes on forever. But, I hope you enjoy it. All these packages have been building up and taking over the space in my apartment. So I needed a way to get through a lot very quickly so I could start putting things away. I know I said not everyone would be featured on camera (since most of these were sent after my announcements that I have closed donations), BUT I feel bad because I know these took time, effort and money. After this batch, I am not going to push myself so hard to include every single one. These unboxings will become less frequent, since I am moving to every other Monday.

That series became a new favorite on my channel, and I decided to allow subscribers to participate by donating their own ugly, used, broken or unwanted squishies. At the time, I had a much smaller audience, but quickly my channel grew and I became overwhelmed with tons of squishy packages.  I am still working on catching up with all the packages I have received in the last few months. I have spent 4 entire videos unboxing squishy donations, and this is the biggest batch so far. Everyone comments on these videos, which squishies they want to see in the makeover videos (4 candidates), and I give the most popular requests a makeover in the next makeover video (every other Friday). These pacakages are donation only, from people who no longer want the squishies or are just interested in seeing them on camera. The squishies are not returned to the sender after the makeovers.
