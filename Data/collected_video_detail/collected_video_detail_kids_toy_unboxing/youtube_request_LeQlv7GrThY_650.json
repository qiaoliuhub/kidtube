When your kiddos make sounds or roar at him, he\u2019ll bow and playfully roar right back at them! His back legs move as does his head and ears to it\u2019s really like he\u2019s about to come alive. Luckily he\u2019s just a soft fur toy with deep green eyes so everyone at home is safe!\n\nTyler is also interactive in other ways outside of his cute little roar. If you pet his forehead, his back, or his muzzle he\u2019s respond with a variety of movements and tiger-like sounds. But don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s also soft enough to hug and cuddle all day long too. One of our other favorite things is the little toy rubber chicken that comes with Tyler. That\u2019s his play toy to and he loves to play and interact with him too. And when that chicken squeaks, Tyler the Tiger is all into it.\n\nFREE NEW MERMAID APP click https://mermaid.app.link/ujy845jaXG\nThe app has all 9 full seasons for free.

Aria unboxes, her new tiger friend, and plays with him. Pippy, her dog, plays too! \nTyler has over 100 sound and motion combinations so he\u2019s pretty much as interactive as they come. When your kiddos make sounds or roar at him, he\u2019ll bow and playfully roar right back at them! His back legs move as does his head and ears to it\u2019s really like he\u2019s about to come alive. Luckily he\u2019s just a soft fur toy with deep green eyes so everyone at home is safe!\n\nTyler is also interactive in other ways outside of his cute little roar. If you pet his forehead, his back, or his muzzle he\u2019s respond with a variety of movements and tiger-like sounds. But don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s also soft enough to hug and cuddle all day long too. One of our other favorite things is the little toy rubber chicken that comes with Tyler. That\u2019s his play toy to and he loves to play and interact with him too. And when that chicken squeaks, Tyler the Tiger is all into it.\n\nFREE NEW MERMAID APP click https://mermaid.app.link/ujy845jaXG\nThe app has all 9 full seasons for free.
