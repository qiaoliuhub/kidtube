It all depends on how you play with your Furby. So when you are feeding, tickling, shaking, tilting or turning it, pulling its tail, speaking to it or playing music for it, keep in mind that your actions will shape its personality. Play nicely with Furby and it may develop a sweet personality, but, pull its tail, shake and turn it upside down and a mischievous side of Furby may appear.\nFurby has a mind of its own. You see, Furby has likes and dislikes just like you. You will discover them as you and Furby get to know one another. Furby will express its emotions to you in a variety of ways, expressive LED eyes are just one of many ways. Furby may not react or behave the way you expect or the way you want, so you may be happy about some of its reactions and not so happy about others.\nThere is something you should know about Furby. Furby can be unpredictable. Be careful how you treat Furby. Who your Furby becomes may surprise you. So, are you ready to handle a Furby?\nFurby can also recognise another Furby, place two side by side and they will interact, including dancing together or having a conversation. Introduce your Furby to other Furbys and see what happens. Again, you never know how your Furby will react, so it may get along well with some Furbys and may have a bad attitude with others.\nWhen you first meet your Furby, it will speak Furbish. But the more you play with Furby, the more English it will start speaking. Not sure what your Furby is saying? Do all those ee-tays and noo-loos have you scratching your head? Then check out the complete Furbish dictionary at www.Furby.com or in the free Furby app to translate Furbish into English and find out what Furby is talking about.\nFeed your Furby. Give your Furby food by using the Furby app that lets you virtually feed your Furby: Feed it a hot pepper and you may see fire in its eyes. Try different foods and see how it responds.\nAdditional Information\nFor additional interactive Furby fun, owners can download the free Furby App for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, available at the App store.

Makes a great gift, Birthday gift, Easter gift or even Christmas gift for ages 3 to 10 years old! \nThis great NextX magnetic drawing board is seriously the best drawing board I have ever seen! I wish I had one of these when I was a little girl! This drawing board is for 3year s old all the way up to 10 years old! My youngest is one and as you will see in the video she was able to use it too and REALLY enjoys it as well. Tiffany Taylor is seriously OBSSESED with this drawing board. She normally gets bored of a new toy in less than a day but this toy she just can\u2019t put down! Tiffany loves to color but I have to admit that she gets too crazy with the crayons, she either ends up breaking them or miss the paper completely and get it all over the table. I don\u2019t know why but it NEVER crossed my mind to get one of these magnetic boards, it definitely would of made my life much easier! As a former preschool teacher I know how important it is to have your work tie their hands. This drawing board is great to encourage fine motor skills in your childs development. It is also a great way to encourage creativity and help children to learn how to express themselves visually. This drawing board would absolutely make the perfect birthday grift that EVERY child is sure to love! \n\nSome cool features (info from their product description) \nSmooth slide to reset: Simply pull the slider across the page to clear the doodle board and set them off on their next adventure\nBright colors bring every drawing to life, 5 kinds of fruit-shaped stamps, colorful magnetic powder, make this a great gift for little artists\nSafe: Durable body is built to take a bash and a battering.
