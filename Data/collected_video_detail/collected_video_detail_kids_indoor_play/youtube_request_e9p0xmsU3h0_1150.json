We Got to play pretend doctor, pretend dentist, pretend play with food and fun size grocery shopping. Caleb loved pushing the little grocery cart around the pretend grocery store. But his favorite part of the Children's museum was the construction area. He played in the sandbox with the trucks and rocks forever! He loves to push the trucks around and fill them up with rocks. He also played pretend mechanic and worked on the cars. It was so cute. \n\nAubrey's favorite part of the kids museum was the indoor playground and indoor slide.
