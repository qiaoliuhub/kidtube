I got home from the spacestation and Jenny said she found this new place not far from us that was a brand new indoor park. It sounded really fun and it would be some great family fun. But this place was even better than we thought. As soon as we got there, Adley was wanting to run and play, she could hardly contain her excitement (and honestly, I felt the same way)!\n\nWe climbed all over his super fun playground toy, with slides and balance bridges, we found trampolines that we did tricks on and one that you could jump on a huge air blob you could jump on. The was a balance beam over a foam pit that Adley and I did tricks on and we found the ultimate ball pit, and it was Niko's first time in one. At first he didn't really seem to understand, but then he started having tons of fun. So cute watching the kids just run all over the place, with some many fun things to do. Adley is a little daredevil, she has no fear! They have an obstacle course machine on some trampolines and Adley does amazing at it!!\n\nThey also have a sky coaster track that Jenny and I took turns riding on. Adley was just a little to short to ride, but she had fun watching her mom and dad zip around the ceiling. We had so much fun and as we were getting ready to leave, we found even more things for us to do. We're definitely going to come back! \n\nEveryone really needs to check this place out. This isn't a brand deal or a partnership, me and my family genuinely had so much fun that I wanted to give them a shout out and thank them for the amazing time!!\n\nUrban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park -- http://www.urbanairtrampolinepark.com/locations/Utah/Clearfield\n\nWhen we get home the kids are literally exhausted and go straight to bed (maybe a new bed time routine lol).

Great video for Kids who loves to have fun playing. Subscribe for more Family fun time:https://goo.gl/SDhNuj\n\nThe boys get to burn off some excess energy in this video taken at Zippy Zoom Indoor Playground in Welland, Ontario. http://zippyzoomplayground.com/\n\nThe facility is 8000 sq ft and includes several slides,  tons of plasma cars, a ball pit, ball blasters, a ball fountain machine, a spinner seat, a waterbed/trampoline and fully padded floors.  The facility is well built with all the kids safety in mind.  Even the parents can follow the little ones into the playground and get a workout themselves.  We've seen adults try and enjoy the plasma cars in the facility as well!\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable and if the kiddies enjoy themselves a lot, then we suggest getting a monthly membership or even a yearly.  This is a sure cure for those winter blues when outdoor playground activities are not possible due to weather.  Zippy Zoom also has a small snack bar for snacks and drinks but if that is not enough, they also allow Domino's pizza to deliver.  The facility has enough space for seating while dining and reading as well if that is your preference.  Most importantly, the facility has washrooms onsite for those emergencies that all families with small kids know!\n\nOverall, the trip to Zippy Zoom in Welland, Ontario is well worth the drive!  The kids get to burn off their energy (they slept very well that night!), Dad get to follow along and get some exercise as well and everybody had fun no matter what the weather is outside!  \n\nCheck them out and you might see us there because we are planning on making another visit!\n\nAnd so we say a playground in some languages : \u64cd\u5834 , \u64cd\u573a , d\u05dctsk\u05d9 h\u05e8i\u009at\u05dc , ludejo , cour de r\u05d9cr\u05d9ation , patio de recreo , tempat bermain , \u904a\u3073\u5834 , \u0c86\u0c9f\u0ca6 , \u05de\u05d9\uf894\u05dd \u05d0\u05db\u05d0\u04a3\uf894 , plac zabaw , s\u05d2n ch\u01a1i , terreno di gioco , \u05d4\u05d8\u05e2\uf896\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d0\u05dd\u05e7\u05d8\u05da , \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 , \u05d4\u05d5\u05e2\u05e1\u05da\u05d0\uf896 \u05df\u05db\u05de\u05e9\u05d0\u05d4\u05da\u05d0 , \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \n\n*Playlist*\ncars4David Playlist Video Collection https://goo.gl/ezCdgn\nFamily Fun Adventures: https://goo.gl/IRY0Dt\nGIANT EGG SURPRISE TOYS OPENING: https://goo.gl/Bal11H\nScience Experiments for Kids: https://goo.gl/Ifftzr\nTHOMAS AND FRIENDS Accident Will Happen :Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, Thomas Toy Trains, My First Thomas, Trackmaster,  Take and Play:  https://goo.gl/H1ItDU\nToy Reviews: https://goo.gl/c7y1s2\nD.I.Y. projects and How to: https://goo.gl/gQQvRV\nEaster eggs Coloring and Decorating: https://goo.gl/6emVAa\nFamily fun game and challenges: https://goo.gl/2Wmcct\nHolidays and events: https://goo.gl/PRDp5W\n\n\n*cars4David Channel- https://goo.gl/4N7yjH\n\n*About cars4David*\nJoin David and his brothers ( Bradley and Crosby ) on their quest to search for fun toys!

The facility is well built with all the kids safety in mind.  Even the parents can follow the little ones into the playground and get a workout themselves.  We've seen adults try and enjoy the plasma cars in the facility as well!\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable and if the kiddies enjoy themselves a lot, then we suggest getting a monthly membership or even a yearly.  This is a sure cure for those winter blues when outdoor playground activities are not possible due to weather.  Zippy Zoom also has a small snack bar for snacks and drinks but if that is not enough, they also allow Domino's pizza to deliver.  The facility has enough space for seating while dining and reading as well if that is your preference.  Most importantly, the facility has washrooms onsite for those emergencies that all families with small kids know!\n\nOverall, the trip to Zippy Zoom in Welland, Ontario is well worth the drive!  The kids get to burn off their energy (they slept very well that night!), Dad get to follow along and get some exercise as well and everybody had fun no matter what the weather is outside!  \n\nCheck them out and you might see us there because we are planning on making another visit!\n\nAnd so we say a playground in some languages : \u64cd\u5834 , \u64cd\u573a , d\u05dctsk\u05d9 h\u05e8i\u009at\u05dc , ludejo , cour de r\u05d9cr\u05d9ation , patio de recreo , tempat bermain , \u904a\u3073\u5834 , \u0c86\u0c9f\u0ca6 , \u05de\u05d9\uf894\u05dd \u05d0\u05db\u05d0\u04a3\uf894 , plac zabaw , s\u05d2n ch\u01a1i , terreno di gioco , \u05d4\u05d8\u05e2\uf896\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d0\u05dd\u05e7\u05d8\u05da , \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 , \u05d4\u05d5\u05e2\u05e1\u05da\u05d0\uf896 \u05df\u05db\u05de\u05e9\u05d0\u05d4\u05da\u05d0 , \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \n\n*Playlist*\ncars4David Playlist Video Collection https://goo.gl/ezCdgn\nFamily Fun Adventures: https://goo.gl/IRY0Dt\nGIANT EGG SURPRISE TOYS OPENING: https://goo.gl/Bal11H\nScience Experiments for Kids: https://goo.gl/Ifftzr\nTHOMAS AND FRIENDS Accident Will Happen :Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, Thomas Toy Trains, My First Thomas, Trackmaster,  Take and Play:  https://goo.gl/H1ItDU\nToy Reviews: https://goo.gl/c7y1s2\nD.I.Y. projects and How to: https://goo.gl/gQQvRV\nEaster eggs Coloring and Decorating: https://goo.gl/6emVAa\nFamily fun game and challenges: https://goo.gl/2Wmcct\nHolidays and events: https://goo.gl/PRDp5W\n\n\n*cars4David Channel- https://goo.gl/4N7yjH\n\n*About cars4David*\nJoin David and his brothers ( Bradley and Crosby ) on their quest to search for fun toys!
