Now that we have two guinea pigs, they need a house that is big enough for both of them. So of course I hit up Scott our SpaceStation metal guy to build one! This thing is amazing, but we can\u2019t give you the new house tour till we\u2019re with Adley and Niko. So we load it into the truck and head home!\n\nIt snowed a lot today so we have to be careful caring the new house through the yard and we make it look easy. The kiddos are so stoked when they see it. This place has a little area for the Honey and Pancake to eat, a raised area for them to climb and sleep, and tons of room for them to play. Niko is so excited he can\u2019t wait to get the pets out and put them in their new mansion!\n\nAfter going through the routine of getting the cage all ready for them, we finally move the pigs over to their house and they instantly start exploring and eating the food and treats we put out. It\u2019s so much fun to watch them and be able to pet them in this new design for a house!! It is so unique that we decide that this is a guinea pig SpaceStation. \n\nWith our pets all settled, we show Scott our brand new game, a VR flying game that Adley is really good at. We do some family yoga, we all learn some new jumping tricks thanks to Adley and then we end this best day ever with shadow puppets!!\n\nHuge thanks to Scott for making today an extra special Best Day Ever! -- https://www.instagram.com/metal2wood/\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\nWatch Adley's last video: LEARNING TO FLY!!

Not travel, no routines, just us having as much fun as we possibly can! While everyone is getting ready to head out, Adley and I give you a quick tour of our hotel! Niko Bear is spoiled with his own room cause Adley decided that she needs to share a room with me and Jenny!!\n\nWe load up into our ginormous van and head back to Universal studios! Because of travel, we only got to do the Harry Potter world, so today we are going to have fun in the rest of the park!! Right when we walk in we see some of Adley's favorite characters, Princess Fiona and Shrek!! Adley gets some high fives before we head down to the dinosaur area! The kids have tons of fun running round and exploring, while Jenny and I go on the Jurassic World ride!! (Adley was just a little too short to come with us, but next time!!)\n\nWhile Jenny and the rest of the crew go on more rides, Issac and I do our best Mr. Mom routines and keep an eye on the kiddos while we also look for a churro for Adley.\n\nNext up, we head to an animal actors show and the kiddos love it! Dogs, cats, farm animals, birds!! tons of animals doing tricks and being awesome!! it was tons of fun!! It's almost time to head back to the hotel, but first we get the kiddos the worlds biggest donut! (maybe not the worlds, but its HUGE!!)\n\nBack at the hotel, we get ready to go swim and float in amazing swimming pools.
