You\u2019ll get a playroom tour, more specifically a minimalist playroom tour.  Throughout the minimalist inspired playroom tour you\u2019ll see the 3 play zones kids need, including the messy zone, quiet zone, and play zone.  You\u2019ll see minimalist play space and minimalist inspired playspace. The minimalist playroom illustrates how kids are more likely to engage in independent play when there isn\u2019t clutter from all the toys. Another way to describe this type of playspace is a simplicity play space or simplicity playroom.  The messy zone includes the kids art room or kids craft room.  It\u2019s also set up in a way that it can serve as a  toddler art room or toddler craft room. The playroom tour shows ways to store tiny toys so that it is safe to use as a toddler playroom and toddler play space as well.  With the playspace being minimalist inspired, the minimalist toddler play space and minimalist toddler playroom show how toddlers too can engage in independent play.  Play space design is an important aspect of designing any playroom, playspace, and play area for kids.  It should have natural light where possible as well.  In the quiet zone you can create a cozy space for kids. A nice quiet space for kids where they are able to wind down and read or relax. This can also serve as your cozy space for toddlers. \n\nFor links to toys and supplies featured in the movie go here: http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/#!3-Play-Zones-Every-Kid-Needs/c1rfl/5663959d0cf253336860a61a\n\nSign up to my email list here: www.theparentingjunkie.com\n\n#peacefulparenting VLOG, BOOK & TOY RECOMMENDATIONS HERE: www.theparentingjunkie.com\n\nF A C E B O O K: (Cuz I post inspiring, uplifting things there!)\nhttp://www.facebook.com/theparentingj...\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/parentingjunkie\n\n\nHuge peace and hope you guys like this!\nNEVER MISS AN EPISODE!\nSign-up for my weekly newsletter on my blog \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com \nSubscribe to my channel \u2192 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC53ONFvWH0hU985xkjVLSwQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nSign-up for daily Notes From Your Child \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/notes-from-your-child \nCheck out the Parenting Courses I offer \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/courses \nLearn about the Present Play Membership \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/groups/1759734380954857/ \nBooks I LOVE \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/books-i \n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193Watch more from The Parenting Junkie\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nA Day in My Life (homeschooling 3 littles) \u2192 https://youtu.be/x2NBxw5cXkc \nPlay Space Design \u2013 The 3 Play Zones \u2192 https://youtu.be/E8ag-EDKqj4 \nHandling Tantrums with Dr. Laura Markham \u2192 https://youtu.be/mQrqRaNIA5g\nThe Play Toddlers Need - Schemas \u2192 https://youtu.be/hHzSj0eMbwM \nYour Child HIT You? \u2192 https://youtu.be/OYwIG3nmYGQ \nGoodbye \u201cGood Job!\u201d \u2192 https://youtu.be/L7oArVUe_Jo \nHow to Ignore Your Child \u2192 https://youtu.be/giOhozdaTKw \nShould I Punish My Kids? \u2192 https://youtu.be/mmeZlu_s_rY \nLabeling is Disabling \u2192 https://youtu.be/c7dkWZXBVgA \n\nFOLLOW ME!\nFacebook \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/theparentingjunkie \nInstagram \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/parentingjunkie/ \nTwitter \u2192 https://twitter.com/parentingjunkie", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8ag-EDKqj4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8ag-EDKqj4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8ag-EDKqj4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8ag-EDKqj4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8ag-EDKqj4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "The Parenting Junkie", "tags": ["The Parenting Junkie", "design a play space", "3 play zones kids need", "minimalist play space", "minimalist playroom", "independent play", "simplicity play space", "simplicity playroom", "kids art room", "kids craft room", "toddler art room", "toddler craft room", "toddler playroom", "toddler play space", "minimalist toddler play space", "minimalist toddler playroom", "play space design", "playroom", "playspace", "cozy space for toddlers", "playroom tour", "minimalist playroom tour", "minimalism inspired playroom tour"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Our Playroom Tour // 3 Play Zones Every Kid Needs", "description": "Join the Play Pandemic Challenge \u2192 https://theparentingjunkie.com/challenge\n\nOur Playroom Tour - 3 Play Zones Every Kid Needs\n\nThe Parenting Junkie will walk you through how to design a play space.

Play space design is an important aspect of designing any playroom, playspace, and play area for kids.  It should have natural light where possible as well.  In the quiet zone you can create a cozy space for kids. A nice quiet space for kids where they are able to wind down and read or relax. This can also serve as your cozy space for toddlers. \n\nFor links to toys and supplies featured in the movie go here: http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/#!3-Play-Zones-Every-Kid-Needs/c1rfl/5663959d0cf253336860a61a\n\nSign up to my email list here: www.theparentingjunkie.com\n\n#peacefulparenting VLOG, BOOK & TOY RECOMMENDATIONS HERE: www.theparentingjunkie.com\n\nF A C E B O O K: (Cuz I post inspiring, uplifting things there!)\nhttp://www.facebook.com/theparentingj...\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/parentingjunkie\n\n\nHuge peace and hope you guys like this!\nNEVER MISS AN EPISODE!\nSign-up for my weekly newsletter on my blog \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com \nSubscribe to my channel \u2192 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC53ONFvWH0hU985xkjVLSwQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nSign-up for daily Notes From Your Child \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/notes-from-your-child \nCheck out the Parenting Courses I offer \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/courses \nLearn about the Present Play Membership \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/groups/1759734380954857/ \nBooks I LOVE \u2192 http://www.theparentingjunkie.com/books-i \n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193Watch more from The Parenting Junkie\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nA Day in My Life (homeschooling 3 littles) \u2192 https://youtu.be/x2NBxw5cXkc \nPlay Space Design \u2013 The 3 Play Zones \u2192 https://youtu.be/E8ag-EDKqj4 \nHandling Tantrums with Dr. Laura Markham \u2192 https://youtu.be/mQrqRaNIA5g\nThe Play Toddlers Need - Schemas \u2192 https://youtu.be/hHzSj0eMbwM \nYour Child HIT You? \u2192 https://youtu.be/OYwIG3nmYGQ \nGoodbye \u201cGood Job!\u201d \u2192 https://youtu.be/L7oArVUe_Jo \nHow to Ignore Your Child \u2192 https://youtu.be/giOhozdaTKw \nShould I Punish My Kids? \u2192 https://youtu.be/mmeZlu_s_rY \nLabeling is Disabling \u2192 https://youtu.be/c7dkWZXBVgA \n\nFOLLOW ME!\nFacebook \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/theparentingjunkie \nInstagram \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/parentingjunkie/ \nTwitter \u2192 https://twitter.com/parentingjunkie"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M53S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "114794", "likeCount": "2776", "dislikeCount": "54", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "FP0ZrA9RcWtjtzFVhJBqgbbUR84", "id": "LMrEsJgFB5U", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-07-23T14:15:00Z", "channelId": "UCh3bt19VUPZCw6lnHnMqovA", "title": "STUFFIES!
