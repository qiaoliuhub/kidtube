I got home from the spacestation and Jenny said she found this new place not far from us that was a brand new indoor park. It sounded really fun and it would be some great family fun. But this place was even better than we thought. As soon as we got there, Adley was wanting to run and play, she could hardly contain her excitement (and honestly, I felt the same way)!\n\nWe climbed all over his super fun playground toy, with slides and balance bridges, we found trampolines that we did tricks on and one that you could jump on a huge air blob you could jump on. The was a balance beam over a foam pit that Adley and I did tricks on and we found the ultimate ball pit, and it was Niko's first time in one. At first he didn't really seem to understand, but then he started having tons of fun. So cute watching the kids just run all over the place, with some many fun things to do. Adley is a little daredevil, she has no fear! They have an obstacle course machine on some trampolines and Adley does amazing at it!!\n\nThey also have a sky coaster track that Jenny and I took turns riding on. Adley was just a little to short to ride, but she had fun watching her mom and dad zip around the ceiling. We had so much fun and as we were getting ready to leave, we found even more things for us to do. We're definitely going to come back! \n\nEveryone really needs to check this place out. This isn't a brand deal or a partnership, me and my family genuinely had so much fun that I wanted to give them a shout out and thank them for the amazing time!!\n\nUrban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park -- http://www.urbanairtrampolinepark.com/locations/Utah/Clearfield\n\nWhen we get home the kids are literally exhausted and go straight to bed (maybe a new bed time routine lol).

They had a lot of fun, especially Nicolas who was jumping and swimming in the colorful balls, trowing them everywhere in the playground room. He was like a fish in the water with so many colored balls around him. He played with toys but to our surprise he liked the dolls, probably because he doesn't have dolls at home and were new toys for him.
