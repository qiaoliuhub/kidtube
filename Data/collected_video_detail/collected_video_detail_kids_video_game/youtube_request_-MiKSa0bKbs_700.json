Sometimes, it's not necessarily martial arts techniques that we teach in the games. There are many more important life lessons that we try to teach all of our students. \n\nThis game is called Assault which we took the idea from an old show, American Gladiator. This is one of the most popular games that we run in our summer camps. The kids have to work together to hit the target to win the game. \n\nAs you see there are many lessons that kids will learn when playing this game. Teamwork, cooperation, and leadership. To me, those are much more valuable lessons than learning how to throw a proper kick and a punch. We make sure to emphasize how important it is to practice those life lessons all throughout the camp activities every day. \n\nIf you would like more information please call us at 702-336-1095\n\nSummer is almost here. Do you have Summer activities planned for your kids?\n\nHere is the schedule for camps Summer 2017\n\nWeek 1: June 12th - June 16th  \nWeek 2: June 19th - June 23rd\nWeek 3: June 26th - June 30th\nWeek 4: July 10th - July 14th\nWeek 5: July 17th - July 21th\nWeek 6: July 24th - July 28th\nWeek 7: July 31st - August 4th\nWeek 8: August 7th - August 11th\n\nAll camps run Monday through Friday for 8 weeks this Summer. \nOur address is 11165 S.

Sometimes, it's not necessarily martial arts techniques that we teach in the games. There are many more important life lessons that we try to teach all of our students. \n\nThis game is called Assault which we took the idea from an old show, American Gladiator. This is one of the most popular games that we run in our summer camps. The kids have to work together to hit the target to win the game. \n\nAs you see there are many lessons that kids will learn when playing this game. Teamwork, cooperation, and leadership. To me, those are much more valuable lessons than learning how to throw a proper kick and a punch. We make sure to emphasize how important it is to practice those life lessons all throughout the camp activities every day. \n\nIf you would like more information please call us at 702-336-1095\n\nSummer is almost here.

Great for toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarten children.\n\nAll of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.  \n\nOur unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you\u2019re sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDC14xuOcM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDC14xuOcM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDC14xuOcM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDC14xuOcM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrDC14xuOcM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Maple Leaf Learning Playhouse", "tags": ["feelings game", "feelings game for kids", "feeling games for children", "feelings game for kindergarten", "feelings activity", "feelings activity for preschoolers", "learn feelings", "learn emotions", "learn emotions and feelings", "feelings vocabulary", "emotions vocabulary", "learn", "feelings", "emotions", "game", "activity", "kids", "children", "toddlers", "preschool", "kindergarten", "education", "marty moose", "maple leaf learning", "feelings song", "if you're happy and you know it", "maple leaf learning playhouse", "maple", "leaf"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Feelings Masks Game for Kids | Maple Leaf Learning Playhouse", "description": "Let's make and play the Feelings Masks Game for kids and then sing the Feelings Song (If You're Happy)!

Great for toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarten children.\n\nAll of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.  \n\nOur unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you\u2019re sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M20S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "132845", "likeCount": "253", "dislikeCount": "52", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "OPr4n6IvsDUW7EXPn_iH0VCUbV0", "id": "mSHHhJh7fGQ", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-08-31T07:27:02Z", "channelId": "UCdgcwrnwzReWLqZe4-smoNQ", "title": "Colorful Game -
