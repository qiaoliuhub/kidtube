But at the moment such a radical change in orbital inclination of satellites is impossible. In this video, the rocket is launched in the Far East of Russia (where the new spaceport called Vostochny Cosmodrome is located), and the rocket\u2019s separated stages fall into the Pacific Ocean. After about 10 minutes, the manned transport spacecraft Mizyaka-Dizyaka already goes into orbit and becomes an artificial satellite of the Earth. First, it flies over New Zealand, then over Antarctica, next Europe and the Northwest and Far East of Russia, before changing the inclination of its orbit and beginning moving against the rotation of the Earth. \n\n3) We decided to add to our video a talking on-board computer, which reports information about the flight, and decided to give the role of talking with the MCC to the voice of the moderator, adding a special sound effect simulating a radio link. \n\n4) The gliding descent of the command module to Earth usually takes several hours, but only a few seconds of this process are shown in our video. \n\n5) At the end of this video, the children will surely be delighted to see the familiar tugboat from our previous \u201cConstruction game\u201d series. In reality, a large aircraft carrier is used to transport the reentered spacecraft. \n\n6) Astronauts do not actually drink water and other drinks in bottles like in our video, but in soft foil bags with straws.

There\u2019s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children\u00b4s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there\u2019s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn\u2019t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child\u2019s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4.

There\u2019s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children\u00b4s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there\u2019s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn\u2019t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child\u2019s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases.

Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions. - -\n-\n-\n#ClintusGames #Fortnite #squads"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H1M26S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "246170", "likeCount": "2138", "dislikeCount": "111", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "394"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/0bzvm2", "/m/025zzc", "/m/0403l3g", "/m/0bzvm2", "/m/025zzc"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "WfOEicxRHpIf0dGutvI4UQGBuzw", "id": "ilR7xumAEwE", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-01-27T03:06:44Z", "channelId": "UCFsLEAbWprS7OHuGDLlP-DQ", "title": "Play Doh Create ABC Alphabet Game - Gameplay with Gertit", "description": "Play Doh Create ABC Alphabet Game - Gameplay with Gertit \n\u2665 Subscribe & Become an GERTITER \u27a5 http://youtube.com/GertitToysReview?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#gertit #Playdoh #GertitGaming\n\n\u2665 Welcome to Gertit's Adventures Channel\n\u2665 Subscribe my Channel for new Videos: gertit.ch/games\n\u2665 Awesome play doh videos:\n\nPlay Doh Learn Abc letter B - Play do for kids learning abc song youtube with playdough https://youtu.be/pqflIW7ZdEM\n\n\u2665 LIKE \u2665 COMMENT \u2665 SUBSCRIBE my Channel for new trips....\n\u2665 If you have any request, please type it in Comments.\n\u2665 Thank you very much one more time for your support!!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR7xumAEwE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR7xumAEwE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR7xumAEwE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR7xumAEwE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR7xumAEwE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Gerti ToysReview", "tags": ["play doh create abcs", "play doh alphabet", "play doh game", "play doh gertit", "gertit play doh", "play doh", "play dough", "play-doh", "gertit's adventures", "playdough", "playdoh", "play doh abc", "playdough abc", "abc play doh", "alphabet play doh", "gertit toysreview", "gertit toy review", "play dogh", "gertit toys review", "gertit"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Play Doh Create ABC Alphabet Game - Gameplay with Gertit", "description": "Play Doh Create ABC Alphabet Game - Gameplay with Gertit \n\u2665 Subscribe & Become an GERTITER \u27a5 http://youtube.com/GertitToysReview?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#gertit #Playdoh #GertitGaming\n\n\u2665 Welcome to Gertit's Adventures Channel\n\u2665 Subscribe my Channel for new Videos: gertit.ch/games\n\u2665 Awesome play doh videos:\n\nPlay Doh Learn Abc letter B - Play do for kids learning abc song youtube with playdough https://youtu.be/pqflIW7ZdEM\n\n\u2665 LIKE \u2665 COMMENT \u2665 SUBSCRIBE my Channel for new trips....\n\u2665 If you have any request, please type it in Comments.\n\u2665 Thank you very much one more time for your support!!!"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M34S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "55822", "likeCount": "160", "dislikeCount": "23", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn", "/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "8dVy0twokREziyF6rMpe2sVFjh0", "id": "XDsyGIW9LDk", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-12-20T08:30:00Z", "channelId": "UCax-4TdDh3oetlyh-GoL7UA", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Ninja Turtle Legends Game App | ToysReviewToys | Kids Toys", "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles play the Ninja Turtle Legends game app with Karai and Newtralizer running with Leo, by ToysReviewToys.
