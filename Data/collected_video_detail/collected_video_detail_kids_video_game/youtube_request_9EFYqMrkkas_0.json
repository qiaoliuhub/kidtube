This is Fun Learning With Toys Channel FLWT with a super special video of Floogals games online live gameplay!  In this video we're going to help the Floogals in a mission where we will learn colors with the Floogals!  In this mission we have to help the Floogals match the same colored bubbles with each other.  The more bubbles we get, the higher score we get!  After we complete the mission we get a new sticker.  It's a different sticker every time!\n\nThis is a really fun Floogals game and is a great representation of colours for kids to learn.  During the lesson I name the different colors that show up so children can retain the information through repetition.  The Floogals game is one of the great kids games to play for free.  It is available on the sprout TV website as a free service and is available for anyone to play.  When the Floogals learn colors, the kids will too, because this is one of the most engaging children games out there.  The music, the soundtrack features the iconic Floogals theme playing in the background while the but if you want something more befitting a game is going on.  It doesn't have the lyrics though, only an instrumental version.  This is a baby game that will not only help them learn colors but also their numbers because while finding the bubbles of various types, we count along from time to time.  \n\nThis game appeals to a wide audience.  This can be enjoyed as one of the kids games for girls. Floogals is definitely a Sprout show that appeals to both boys and girls.  There are three Floogals, Fleeker, Boomer, and Flo.  Flo is the second lieutenant of the cosmic crew and is the reasonable and level headed Floogal of the bunch. She helps Fleeker and Boomer when they make mistakes and  is always there to help save the day.  Girls will enjoy having a cool and fun character to look up to and always knows the right thing to do.  On the other hand, this is one of those very versatile video games.  It can be a great example of one of the kids games for boys.  Fleeker and Captain Boomer are two fun loving floogals who love to discover things and get into adventures.  Captain Fleeker is usually wrong about the things he investigates, and Flo Floogal sets the record straight and Fleeker usually takes the credit.  After the end of each sprout floogals episodes, all three floogals come together to make an important discovery.  They learn about whatever object they were trying to explore and learn a little more about what Humans are doing on earth. \n\nFloogals are one of those very well made preschool shows.  Each episode is set up from the perspective of a group of three toddlers and everyone gets to explore together.  It has all of the common tropes of an adventure show for kids.  They have fun, and interesting topics, a whole episode to focus on that eventually leads to a resolution that leaves everyone happy.  The Floogals game online tries to mimic the feeling of a children's adventure show.  Kids get to play along and learn their colors while one of their favorite Floogals characters looks on.  It's one of those kids games that that provide a fun and compelling puzzle for kids but isn't too difficult or too easy.  The game offer three difficulty settings: easy, medium, and hard.  During the game play, I play on the hard difficulty setting so viewers can see the game played in the most optimum level that I am capable off.  For it to be on the same level as any other adventure show, the game should be played on either on easy or medium mode.  There are not too many differences between the modes, except that there are bigger bubbles on the screen.  This allows players to group more bubbles together and makes it easier to get a larger score.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Fun Learning With Toys", "tags": ["Floogals", "floogals games online", "floogals game", "floogals learn colors", "baby game", "children games", "games", "kids games for boys", "kids games for girls", "video games", "free", "kids games", "puzzle", "adventure shows", "children\u2019s adventure shows", "game play", "children\u2019s cartoons", "preschoolers game", "sprout", "sprout tv", "sprout floogals", "preschool shows", "sprout shows", "colours for kids to learn", "children", "learn colors", "toddlers", "kids games to play for free", "Fun Learning With Toys", "FLWT"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Floogals Learn Colors!

This is Fun Learning With Toys Channel FLWT with a super special video of Floogals games online live gameplay!  In this video we're going to help the Floogals in a mission where we will learn colors with the Floogals!  In this mission we have to help the Floogals match the same colored bubbles with each other.  The more bubbles we get, the higher score we get!  After we complete the mission we get a new sticker.  It's a different sticker every time!\n\nThis is a really fun Floogals game and is a great representation of colours for kids to learn.  During the lesson I name the different colors that show up so children can retain the information through repetition.  The Floogals game is one of the great kids games to play for free.  It is available on the sprout TV website as a free service and is available for anyone to play.  When the Floogals learn colors, the kids will too, because this is one of the most engaging children games out there.  The music, the soundtrack features the iconic Floogals theme playing in the background while the but if you want something more befitting a game is going on.  It doesn't have the lyrics though, only an instrumental version.  This is a baby game that will not only help them learn colors but also their numbers because while finding the bubbles of various types, we count along from time to time.  \n\nThis game appeals to a wide audience.  This can be enjoyed as one of the kids games for girls. Floogals is definitely a Sprout show that appeals to both boys and girls.  There are three Floogals, Fleeker, Boomer, and Flo.  Flo is the second lieutenant of the cosmic crew and is the reasonable and level headed Floogal of the bunch. She helps Fleeker and Boomer when they make mistakes and  is always there to help save the day.  Girls will enjoy having a cool and fun character to look up to and always knows the right thing to do.  On the other hand, this is one of those very versatile video games.  It can be a great example of one of the kids games for boys.  Fleeker and Captain Boomer are two fun loving floogals who love to discover things and get into adventures.  Captain Fleeker is usually wrong about the things he investigates, and Flo Floogal sets the record straight and Fleeker usually takes the credit.  After the end of each sprout floogals episodes, all three floogals come together to make an important discovery.  They learn about whatever object they were trying to explore and learn a little more about what Humans are doing on earth. \n\nFloogals are one of those very well made preschool shows.  Each episode is set up from the perspective of a group of three toddlers and everyone gets to explore together.  It has all of the common tropes of an adventure show for kids.  They have fun, and interesting topics, a whole episode to focus on that eventually leads to a resolution that leaves everyone happy.  The Floogals game online tries to mimic the feeling of a children's adventure show.  Kids get to play along and learn their colors while one of their favorite Floogals characters looks on.  It's one of those kids games that that provide a fun and compelling puzzle for kids but isn't too difficult or too easy.  The game offer three difficulty settings: easy, medium, and hard.  During the game play, I play on the hard difficulty setting so viewers can see the game played in the most optimum level that I am capable off.  For it to be on the same level as any other adventure show, the game should be played on either on easy or medium mode.  There are not too many differences between the modes, except that there are bigger bubbles on the screen.  This allows players to group more bubbles together and makes it easier to get a larger score.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2fghQykMUI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Fun Learning With Toys", "tags": ["Floogals", "floogals games online", "floogals game", "floogals learn colors", "baby game", "children games", "games", "kids games for boys", "kids games for girls", "video games", "free", "kids games", "puzzle", "adventure shows", "children\u2019s adventure shows", "game play", "children\u2019s cartoons", "preschoolers game", "sprout", "sprout tv", "sprout floogals", "preschool shows", "sprout shows", "colours for kids to learn", "children", "learn colors", "toddlers", "kids games to play for free", "Fun Learning With Toys", "FLWT"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Floogals Learn Colors!
