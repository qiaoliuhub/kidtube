The app's offerings will continue to expand as the Starfall Team transitions the popular website's content for delivery to mobile devices.\n\nStarfall is the brain-child of Stephen Schutz. At age 9, Stephen was still struggling to read. What came easily for his peers required many more hours of his work. As a reader, he was consistently toward the bottom of his class. Now a PhD in physics and a successful publisher and artist, Dr. Schutz, with the help of his dedicated team, created Starfall to ensure today's children have resources that can help.\n\n\nMy Channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/iGameplay1337\nSubscribe - http://youtube.com/user/iGameplay1337?sub_confirmation=1\nFollow my Twitter - http://twitter.com/Andromalic\nMy Apple GameCenter ID: Andromalic (USA)\nPSN ID: iGameplay_1337 (USA)\nNEW STEAM ACCOUNT: ANDROMALIC\nADD TO FRIENDS !"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT6M18S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "410270", "likeCount": "426", "dislikeCount": "156", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "48"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/0bzvm2", "/m/0bzvm2"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "8Y7vVbzJuxhOfgDKp9M4T7Eq6Rg", "id": "dMG5e9VxNpY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-05-07T07:05:55Z", "channelId": "UC7d2jS2Nsz8k5qtG8uD0Yxg", "title": "Kids Animal Word Puzzles \"CFC s.r.o.
