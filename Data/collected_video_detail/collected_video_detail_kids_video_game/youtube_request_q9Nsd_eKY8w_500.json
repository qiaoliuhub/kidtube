The game was developed exclusively for the Wii and Nintendo DS, as well as for Microsoft Windows. The video game is developed and published by Disney Interactive Studios. It was released on November 23, 2010 in North America only.\nThe story follows that of the film very closely. In a faraway kingdom, a king sought a cure for his wife's life-threatening ailment. After hearing of a magical flower that could cure everything, he ordered a broth made of the flower, and his wife was immediately cured. The trade-off was that their newborn daughter had long, flowing blonde hair that possessed its own healing powers. Hearing of this discovery, an evil witch kidnapped the infant princess, locked her away in a tower, raised her as her own child and warned her of the horrors of the outside world. Years later, a bandit by the name of Flynn Rider came upon the tower and found himself knocked out by the now-teenage princess named Rapunzel. After agreeing to hide his stolen stash, she made a deal with the bandit: The stash would be returned only if he agreed to show her the kingdom where flying lanterns were released every night on her birthday.\nCharacters:\nRapunzel , Flynn Rider , Mother Gothel , Pascal , Maximus , The Stabbington Brothers , Hook Hand , Big Nose , Vladimir , Shorty , Ulf , Attila , Pub Thugs , Captain of the Guards ,The King of Corona , The Queen of Corona , Four Sisters , Castle Guards\n\nLocations:\nThe Tower , First Frolic , Snuggly Duckling , Thieves\u2019 Highway , Horse Chase , Castle Island Village , Village Waterfront , Celebration Race\n \n Disney Tangled name in other languages are:\nTangled , , Nahaspilatuta , Rapunzel , \u039c\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 , \u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u3082\u3064\u308c , \ub514\uc988\ub2c8 \uc5bd\ud78c , \u043e\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0446\u043e\u043b\u0434\u043e\u043d , \u0420\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c , Zaplatani , Raperonzolo ,", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdSyJ_Ke9AU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdSyJ_Ke9AU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdSyJ_Ke9AU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdSyJ_Ke9AU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdSyJ_Ke9AU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Persching1", "tags": ["Tangled (Film)", "Walt", "disney", "pictures", "new", "World", "Rapunzel", "animation", "cinema", "Cartoon", "Film (Film)", "comedy", "funny", "raiponce", "Queen", "King", "toys", "Disney Toys", "Princess", "Frog", "Prinzessin", "Crazy", "Disne", "Gameplay", "Disneyland", "Kid", "Kids", "Games", "Game", "Video Game", "Play", "Tower", "First Frolic", "Snuggly Duckling", "Kid Games", "New Game", "Compilation", "Voll", "Top", "Story", "Stories", "Film", "Trailer", "wii", "xbox", "Tangled: The Video Game", "Ps3", "Playstation", "Xbox 360", "Toys"], "categoryId": "20", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "#1 Disney Tangled - Rapunzel  - Video Game - Gameplay - Game Movie For Kids - kids movie", "description": "Video Game -  Disney Tangled\nSubscription - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuueuFXxRFtMcWqWztv-Qg\nPlaylists - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2P09jtYUVu2WUZGdLBGPgESgEhmSX6vc\n\nTangled: The Video Game is a video game based on the 2010 film Tangled.
