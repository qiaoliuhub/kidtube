It is produced by Spin Master Entertainment, with animation provided by Guru Studio. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOntario, which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 12, 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of search and rescue dogs that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in doghouses that transform into customized vehicles for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a media franchise and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. PAW Patrol toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.[2] The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes.[3] In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on Noggin, for free with TV Everywhere authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the Hoopla app.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.[4] A theatrical feature film, titled PAW Patrol: The Movie, is scheduled for an August 2021 release.\n\n#SONNYKIDSTV #Pawpatrolgames  #Pawpatrol247", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0R_FfZLLcKk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0R_FfZLLcKk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0R_FfZLLcKk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0R_FfZLLcKk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0R_FfZLLcKk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "SONNY GAMES", "tags": ["SONNYKIDSTV", "Paw Patrol Flip and Match", "Paw Patrol Games", "Paw Patrol", "Flip and Match", "paw patrol full episodes", "paw patrol toys", "paw patrol pluzze", "#\u30d1\u30a6\u30d1\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "\u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0628", "paw", "patrol", "nick jr", "game paw patrol", "paw patrol mighty pups copycat", "Paw Patrol Pawsome Missions", "Patrol Pawsome Missions", "Paw Patrol Pawsome"], "categoryId": "20", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Paw Patrol Games #63: Paw Patrol Pawsome Missions Game for Kids", "description": "Welcome to SONNY KIDS TV\n\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol Games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPFVIbiPTNE&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3dfSg9GVtclTXGpAGL2da-In\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol on a Roll: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2bMCVrWo&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3dd7OSpgwv6YfgZx1rKwHVip\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol A Day in Adventure Bay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5vRXPC9pkY&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3ddt9uvqawDOb51sehNwITC9\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol Air & Sea Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPFhRhkYCPo&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3delBP6zjYS8ZbEA1VKYq5mw\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol Rescue Run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjVTY93MFU&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3dc38Fdq2cVBL9VbnAnCtSb-\n\ud83d\udd34Paw Patrol Dino Rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EvDdIyeruI&list=PLA8CWwk6Q3ddf_DZ6HQe_FHhFVPwEoDDo\n\nPAW Patrol is a Canadian CGI\u2013animated children's television series created by Keith Chapman.

It is the sequel and successor of the 2013 video game Disney Infinity and was announced on April 8, 2014. \n\nFeaturing original story material by Brian Michael Bendis, Marvel Super Heroes includes multiple plots and includes characters from both Marvel and Disney properties. The main campaign is divided into three stories. The first storyline follows the Avengers as they prevent the Norse God Loki from rebuilding the Casket of Ancient Winters. The second storyline centers on Spider-Man and features him and his team tasked with the objective to stop Green Goblin's symbiote invasion. The third and final storyline concentrates around the Guardians of the Galaxy, in a plot heavily inspired by the Guardians of the Galaxy film, where the Guardians must protect Knowhere from Ronan the Accuser.\n\nDisney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes expands Disney Infinity's array of tools to use in the Toybox mode, an open world sandbox. Additionally, the ability to personalize individual characters has been added, using a Skill Tree. Marvel Super Heroes adds on the previous game's community sharing options, including the sharing of personal creations.\n\nIt was also the first Marvel-licensed game to be published by Disney Interactive Studios, due to Sega's contract with Marvel expiring after the release of Captain America: Super Soldier in 2011, and Activision's contract expiring after the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, released a few months prior to the release of the game. A sequel, Disney Infinity 3.0, was released on August 28, 2015 in Europe and August 29, 2015 in North America.\n\n\nThank you so much for watching this video.
