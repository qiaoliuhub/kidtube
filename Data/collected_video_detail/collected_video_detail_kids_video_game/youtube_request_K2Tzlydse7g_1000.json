You'll jump chasms, pelt other kids with snowballs (which turn them to ice), and collect points while trying to get to first.\n\nTurbo Kids looks simple and kiddie, and while it may indeed be on the cartoony side, doesn't mean that it's not a fun game.  Behind the name and the simple graphics is a solid platformer.\n\nAs aforementioned, the graphics are cartoony and kiddie.  This is not to mean that they're bad though, on the contrary, the graphical style adds a lot to the game by giving it a special charm and aesthetic.  The sprites of the turbo kids are cute and tiny little things that animate very nicely.  Granted, they may only have a few frames of animation each, but coupled with the minimalist design of the levels, it works very well.  While it's a racer, and while you may indeed be racing for first while trying to knock out the competition, the graphical style makes the game feel more relaxed and easy-going.  This is definitely a plus, as without such, you may very well get rather frustrated by the number of times you'll fall behind in the race, or literally fall into a bottomless chasm.\n\nThe audio is another high point of the game, with the voice-overs easily being of professional quality, and definitely not something you'd expect from such a cutesy looking game.  The music is also great, giving the game a feel reminiscent of old-school games without having to resort to chiptunes.  In addition to the music and voice, the sound effects are also of good quality.  Granted, there aren't too many things in the game that'll have sound effects, but those that do work very well.\n\nThe controls are simple enough, you hit x to shoot and c to jump.  Pretty much everything else is controlled by the computer, so the only things you really have to worry about are the timing of your jumps, and hitting your opponents.  This control scheme can be a bit troublesome to get used to at first, especially when you want to go back to pick up some points you missed, but for the most part it works well and is easy enough to get used to.\n\nAs can be guessed, the game is a platformer/racer that puts you in control of a little blue kid.  The little blue kid is racing against other kids, but unlike him, they're red.  You race from point A to point B, jumping across chasms, hitting accelerators to speed ahead of the competition, and jumping onto boosters to enhance your jumps.  It's a simple game, true, but it plays well and will surely capture your attention.  Unfortunately, it's a bit on the short side.\n\nAll in all, Turbo Kids is a fun, short, little game.  It has solid gameplay, and while short, will definitely keep your entertained while it lasts.\n\n\n**********************************************************\nSubscribe to new gaming videos!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/FreeGamesExplorer\n\n**********************************************************", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6BHmpTnKck/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6BHmpTnKck/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6BHmpTnKck/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "Free Games Explorer", "tags": ["free game", "flash game", "gameplay", "video game", "game", "game preview", "trailer", "game trailer", "platformer", "racer", "platform racer", "jumper", "winter racer", "running", "jump racer", "race jumping"], "categoryId": "20", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Turbo Kids - Game preview / gameplay", "description": "Turbo Kids is a charming and fun little racer that puts you in control of said kids who are, of course, turbo.
