Tutorials teach underlying concepts to help children gain the understanding they need to advance through the levels.\n\nMade just for young kids\nWith its simple interface, a controller engineered for little hands and camera optimized to capture a child\u2019s movements, LeapTV transcends the kid-friendly claims of other game systems. LeapTV games include audio instructions for kids who don\u2019t yet read, so even the youngest preschool kids can play.

Kids run, hop and tip-toe to guide Disney Sofia the First along a woodland obstacle course using reading skills. In LeapFrog Sports, children power up math skills as they wave their arms to defend goals, karate-chop fast-moving shapes, scuba dive and more. Kids can also use their energy for creative movements like wiggling and spinning in LeapFrog Dance & Learn. In some games, they\u2019ll even be able to see themselves on TV!\n\nPointer Play\nPointer play takes pretend play to new levels of engagement. It\u2019s easy to use the pointer because it\u2019s made for kids\u2019 hands. When kids swivel the controller with a simple click, they instantly have a pointer for snapping jungle vines and slicing through coconuts with Jake from Disney Jake and the Never Land Pirates! They can go from the island to the city, and play as Marvel Ultimate Spider-Man. Use the pointer to sling webs, swing across tall buildings and save New York!\n\nClassic control\nClassic control puts fun at their fingertips. Press the A and B buttons for fast-paced gaming, or tilt and shake the controller to race in LeapFrog Kart Racing: Supercharged! Solve puzzles with favorite Disney-Pixar characters like Nemo and Dory, Buzz and Woody, Mike and Sulley and more.\n\nExtensive Library of Games and Videos\nOur original, high-quality games get kids up and active, and our educational videos enhance the learning fun.
