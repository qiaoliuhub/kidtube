You must drop your character (Sushi Cat) through a maze which contains sushi for him to eat to make him grow.

The story starts off with Sushi Cat walking along downtown Neko Town, when he spots a pink cat sitting in the window -- soaking up the sun's rays.

I have updated my Easter Games to include video of my family and I playing the games. You can check those updated videos in the playlists linked below. Share the fun with your family today!\n\nEaster Games Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3JyJlapOYTWXAR3XkCUM558hpXRky_e\n\nEaster Egg Hunt Ideas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3JyJlapOYQCzFGCnQovS1IRgTMOPewh&disable_polymer=true\nPurchase plastic eggs in bulk off Amazon for cheap here: http://amzn.to/2EYr9AT\n\nSpecial Gold Eggs: https://amzn.to/2GaoxPw\n\n1. Easter Egg Hunt Variations:\n-Assign each child a different colored egg.\n-Assign each child a different area.\n-Older kids hide eggs for the younger kids.\n-Resurrection Eggs:  https://amzn.to/2WxrUG0\n\n2. Egg in Spoon Relay: Put eggs onto spoons and race to a finish line. A dropped egg sends the person back to where he/she began.\n\n3.Egg Roll: Give each child an egg and roll the egg from point A to point B in a creative way, such as, with nose, with feet, with a spoon, etc.\n\n4.Egg Toss: Playing with a raw egg is more exciting but you could use a weighted plastic egg or boiled egg. Partner up and toss back and forth. Winner is whoever has not dropped their egg.\n\n5. Egg Treasure Hunt: Play just like a regular treasure hunt but put the clues in easter eggs.\n\n6. Steal the Egg: 2 Teams and a referee are needed of this one. Team members are numbered so that each team has even number of members. Teams line up opposite of each other with one egg in the middle. A referee calls out a number and the number from each time races to get to the egg first. The team with the most eggs wins the game.\n\n7. Hot Egg: Play just like Hot Potato but with a weighted egg.\n\n8. Egg Target Toss: You'll need 3 to 6 Hula Hoops. Lay hula hoops on ground in shape of a triangle. Participants toss one egg and see which hoop it lands in.\n\n9. Egg Bowling: Roll an egg through \"bowling pins\" made of decorated oatmeal containers.\n\n10. Egg Charades: played just like regular charades but put the actions into Easter Eggs.\n\nI give credit where credit is due so check out www.thespruce.com for these games and many more! Really cool website for fun ideas.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34Subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://goo.gl/r7kbvi\nEmail me: shawnhowellprayerlights@gmail.com \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd34FOLLOW ME\ud83d\udc63\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Prayerlights36/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/prayerlightsgames/\n\n****************************\nFor Business Inquires email: shawnhowellprayerlights@gmail.com\n****************************\n\n\ud83c\udfacEQUIPMENT SETUP:\nRing Light: http://amzn.to/2qVnRI2\nCanon G7x mark ii: https://amzn.to/2DKJ9O3\n\n\ud83d\udd34SUPPORT MY CHANNEL\nBuy me a Coffee to show your appreciation!\nhttp://ko-fi.com/prayerlights\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I\u2019ll receive a small commission.

I have updated my Easter Games to include video of my family and I playing the games. You can check those updated videos in the playlists linked below. Share the fun with your family today!\n\nEaster Games Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3JyJlapOYTWXAR3XkCUM558hpXRky_e\n\nEaster Egg Hunt Ideas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3JyJlapOYQCzFGCnQovS1IRgTMOPewh&disable_polymer=true\nPurchase plastic eggs in bulk off Amazon for cheap here: http://amzn.to/2EYr9AT\n\nSpecial Gold Eggs: https://amzn.to/2GaoxPw\n\n1. Easter Egg Hunt Variations:\n-Assign each child a different colored egg.\n-Assign each child a different area.\n-Older kids hide eggs for the younger kids.\n-Resurrection Eggs:  https://amzn.to/2WxrUG0\n\n2. Egg in Spoon Relay: Put eggs onto spoons and race to a finish line. A dropped egg sends the person back to where he/she began.\n\n3.Egg Roll: Give each child an egg and roll the egg from point A to point B in a creative way, such as, with nose, with feet, with a spoon, etc.\n\n4.Egg Toss: Playing with a raw egg is more exciting but you could use a weighted plastic egg or boiled egg. Partner up and toss back and forth. Winner is whoever has not dropped their egg.\n\n5. Egg Treasure Hunt: Play just like a regular treasure hunt but put the clues in easter eggs.\n\n6. Steal the Egg: 2 Teams and a referee are needed of this one. Team members are numbered so that each team has even number of members. Teams line up opposite of each other with one egg in the middle. A referee calls out a number and the number from each time races to get to the egg first. The team with the most eggs wins the game.\n\n7. Hot Egg: Play just like Hot Potato but with a weighted egg.\n\n8. Egg Target Toss: You'll need 3 to 6 Hula Hoops. Lay hula hoops on ground in shape of a triangle. Participants toss one egg and see which hoop it lands in.\n\n9. Egg Bowling: Roll an egg through \"bowling pins\" made of decorated oatmeal containers.\n\n10. Egg Charades: played just like regular charades but put the actions into Easter Eggs.\n\nI give credit where credit is due so check out www.thespruce.com for these games and many more! Really cool website for fun ideas.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34Subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://goo.gl/r7kbvi\nEmail me: shawnhowellprayerlights@gmail.com \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd34FOLLOW ME\ud83d\udc63\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Prayerlights36/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/prayerlightsgames/\n\n****************************\nFor Business Inquires email: shawnhowellprayerlights@gmail.com\n****************************\n\n\ud83c\udfacEQUIPMENT SETUP:\nRing Light: http://amzn.to/2qVnRI2\nCanon G7x mark ii: https://amzn.to/2DKJ9O3\n\n\ud83d\udd34SUPPORT MY CHANNEL\nBuy me a Coffee to show your appreciation!\nhttp://ko-fi.com/prayerlights\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I\u2019ll receive a small commission.
