Great for toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarten children.\n\nAll of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.  \n\nOur unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun.
