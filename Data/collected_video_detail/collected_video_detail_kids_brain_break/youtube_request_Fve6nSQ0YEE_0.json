Your children will love doing this song over and over because it actively engages them with what they are learning. We keep the movements very simple so all children can easily participate. Letting our children experience learning with their brain and body helps them make deeper emotional, interpersonal and kinesthetic connections to the academic subject. According to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Professor John Ratey, in a 2008 Education Week article, \u201cphysical exercise puts the brain of the child in the optimal position for learning.\u201d\n\nI say the letter sounds very clearly and accurately. I don't extend additional sounds to the individual sound of each letter. Your children follow my suggested movements as they say the letter, the sound and a word beginning with the letter. \n\nTeachers and reading specialists have guided us to say the letter sound before the word for your children to hear the initial letter sound starting the word.
