It was even better than we imagined!\n\nWe met up with a professional Disney on Ice figure skater, Morgan, who gave us some great information for kids interested in ice skating. Then we met the stars of the show, Mickey and Minnie at the Disney Blogger event. The tots loved the Olaf and Mickey collectible cups, Elsa and Mickey glow sticks and the whole experience. The show starts off with Minnie and Mickey, Donald and Goofy. We see Andy and all the beloved toys of Toy Story, Woody, Jessie, Buzz. The next act is Little Mermaid with Ariel, Sebastian, Ursula and Flounder. After the intermission we see Lightening McQueen, Mater and all the favorites from Disney's Cars. The show ends with an amazing performance by the characters in Frozen! Our favorites, Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff skate around Arendell and everyone sings Let it Go! Our 3 and 4 year old kids were fascinated by Disney on Ice the entire time! Check out the upcoming shows in your area.

It can be any colour you choose\n\nThe butterfly is fluttering its wings just above your toes....\n\nIf you really pay attention, can you feel the soft breeze from the butterfly's wings on your toes?\n\nNow the butterfly is floating along your legs to your knees.... \n\nCan you feel a little tingling feeling from its wings on your legs?\n\nIf you can\u2019t feel anything, just imagine what it would feel like if you could,\n\nNow the butterfly is fluttering its wings as it moves up to your belly button....\n\nCan you feel it tickling your belly as it flies around?\n\nTry to imagine what the butterfly\u2019s wings look like?\n\nMaybe you can see them, and feel them fluttering at the same time in your imagination?\n\nNow the butterfly is floating up and down your arms,\n\nFrom your shoulder to your hands and back\n\nFeel it with your imagination as it flies up and down each arm, \n\nAnd now, just before flying off, the butterfly is coming to wish you a beautiful day,\n\nAs it flutters its wings just above your forehead!\n\nSee it floating there in your mind,\n\nFeel the fluttering of its wings\n\nIf you listen very closely, you might be able to hear them flutter,\n\nAnd now, off it flies..\n\nLeaving you feeling very warm and cozy,\n\nJust lying in the sunshine... \n\nNow, let\u2019s just sit quietly and breathe for just a bit longer until you hear the bell.\""}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT7M14S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "686981", "likeCount": "1835", "dislikeCount": "235", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "124"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/019_rr", "/m/019_rr"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "aP5notUcYTdjSxc2YBO2o1Yq0WE", "id": "PwNpHPfWBps", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-05-22T11:30:03Z", "channelId": "UCauqnJyP4IyALaEMyVdDzTQ", "title": "Dance & Freeze- BlackBerry Jam Kids Music Brain Break", "description": "#DanceAndFreeze #BrainBreak #BlackBerryJamKidsMusic\n\nHey Jam Fam!

This quiet time music for the classroom has also been tested in a French immersion classroom in Canada where a group of 25 grade two's listened to the music for every day for a week. In addition to the teacher reporting lower stress for herself she said that the students were better behaved, more positive in their interactions and generally more focused on learning while the music was playing. A number of students around the world have also tested the music at home as study music and have generally found it useful for them in making their study and homework time more enjoyable.\n\nIf this relaxing music for kids helps your class or child to learn better or to relax please leave a comment below letting us know.
