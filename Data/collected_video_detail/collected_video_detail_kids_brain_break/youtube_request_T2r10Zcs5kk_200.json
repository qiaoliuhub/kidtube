In this subitizing song  name the numbers in each set of dots, ten frames and fingers. Subitizing develops math fluency, when students recognize sets without having to count each object and it helps develop number sense and the ability to perform mental math. In this version we subitize up to 5 and then give the answer for reinforcement.

Favourite animal song from kindyRock - great songs for little kids.\n\n\u201cSidney the Snake\u201d is a huge favourite song with preschoolers and toddlers. It\u2019s a fun, action song for children that uses lots of animals and that they love to sing and dance along to.  It's a super easy song to sing along to and also super easy as an action and movement song for kids. With a snake the slithers, a frog that jumps, a seagull that flies, an elephant that sways and a crocodile that snaps along!\n\n\nKids love to sing and dance and move along with action songs just for children.  \u201cSidney the Snake\u201d really is a great animal song. With actions and movement to suit every child\u2019s ability.\n\nSing along with kindyRock creator Judi Cranston and her young friend Imogen, as she takes you through simple actions of 5 favourites animals and the way they move their bodies. The tempo gets slower at the end too, making this so much fun to sing along to. Help your children to be creative by showing them how to make up their own actions, learn new language and of course TO HAVE FUN! Children love to sing and dance to their own songs as well as kindyRock songs.\n\nIf you have landed on this Youtube channel it\u2019s probably because you are a teacher to children aged under 7 years, you've heard about us through a school, kindergarten, daycare, yoga or music class, you're an in home educator or a parent who understands the importance of music education for children's development.  \n\nAt kindyRock we want to help support you in your teaching by providing you with Quality Music Education Resources.\n\nAs a teacher you will probably know how important and effective music is for our children\u2019s brains and that you should be doing music regularly, even on a daily basis in your classes! If you don't feel comfortable singing, that's where we make it easy for you, guiding you and the children through these easy to remember songs, designed to support you and their learning needs.\n\nYour children will love using their voices to sing , their hands to do the actions and their eyes to follow along with Judi Cranston. Your kids will have a blast with this exciting, silly and fun song! You can incorporate and encourage your children to join in which also helps them with rhythm and is perfect for brain breaks, circle time, group activities or those bad weather days when children can't go outside to play.\n\nSidney the Snake  is also easy and fun to play or pretend to play when you need a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh, they can then return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed.

Favourite animal song from kindyRock - great songs for little kids.\n\n\u201cSidney the Snake\u201d is a huge favourite song with preschoolers and toddlers. It\u2019s a fun, action song for children that uses lots of animals and that they love to sing and dance along to.  It's a super easy song to sing along to and also super easy as an action and movement song for kids. With a snake the slithers, a frog that jumps, a seagull that flies, an elephant that sways and a crocodile that snaps along!\n\n\nKids love to sing and dance and move along with action songs just for children.  \u201cSidney the Snake\u201d really is a great animal song. With actions and movement to suit every child\u2019s ability.\n\nSing along with kindyRock creator Judi Cranston and her young friend Imogen, as she takes you through simple actions of 5 favourites animals and the way they move their bodies. The tempo gets slower at the end too, making this so much fun to sing along to. Help your children to be creative by showing them how to make up their own actions, learn new language and of course TO HAVE FUN! Children love to sing and dance to their own songs as well as kindyRock songs.\n\nIf you have landed on this Youtube channel it\u2019s probably because you are a teacher to children aged under 7 years, you've heard about us through a school, kindergarten, daycare, yoga or music class, you're an in home educator or a parent who understands the importance of music education for children's development.  \n\nAt kindyRock we want to help support you in your teaching by providing you with Quality Music Education Resources.\n\nAs a teacher you will probably know how important and effective music is for our children\u2019s brains and that you should be doing music regularly, even on a daily basis in your classes! If you don't feel comfortable singing, that's where we make it easy for you, guiding you and the children through these easy to remember songs, designed to support you and their learning needs.\n\nYour children will love using their voices to sing , their hands to do the actions and their eyes to follow along with Judi Cranston. Your kids will have a blast with this exciting, silly and fun song! You can incorporate and encourage your children to join in which also helps them with rhythm and is perfect for brain breaks, circle time, group activities or those bad weather days when children can't go outside to play.\n\nSidney the Snake  is also easy and fun to play or pretend to play when you need a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh, they can then return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed.
