Children see the movements and follow along.  Kids hear and see the clapping pattern, clap along to the pattern and move their body. \n\nClapping Machine really helps your children listen carefully for the auditory queues and visual clapping pattern and see the dance movements. They have a chance to follow me exactly, as I show them the clapping pattern and the movement. The repetition in this brain breaks song is wonderful for young children as it helps them to anticipate the auditory pattern and movement. Recognizing patterns like the ones in my song, and in the world around us builds critical math and reading skills. \n\nTaking brain breaks is very helpful for children to do their best schoolwork.  Music, movement and fun allows them to refresh and recharge their brain and body. Use Clapping Machine anytime in the classroom or at home for a fun and developmentally appropriate  brain break activity for young children.

If the words rhyme then they do a cool Hip \u2013Hop dance, and if the words don\u2019t rhyme they get a chance to move and say - No way, no way.\n Listening for the parts of sounds in words at the beginning, middle and ending really helps children develop their phonological awareness (hearing the parts of words) skills so important in becoming a successful reader.\nThis song is so cool it will really help make learning about rhyming fun for all your children.\n Make a Rhyme, Make a Move includes Jack Hartmann and Rachel Smith singing together. Both Rachel and Jack show your children the different moves and dances they can do. And, this rhyming song features rhyming that is simple and easy to follow.\nStudies show that having the ability to recognize and be aware of words that rhyme is a good predictor of future successful reading in the future.\nHelp make rhyming fun for your children and sing, dance and listen for those rhymes!\n\nLyrics:\n\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nYou can do it \u2013 I can too \n\nChorus  \n\nMake a rhyme, make a move Do it to the beat\nMake a rhyme, make a move Have some fun with me  \n\nWhen the two words rhyme make a move like this \nTwo thumbs, crisscross, say that rhymes that rhymes \nWhen the words don\u2019t rhyme make a move like this \nOne arm out front, back and forth say no way, no way   \n\nCat - hat   that rhymes (2x)\n Dog \u2013 frog   that rhymes (2x) \nCan \u2013 mat  no way (2x) \nPig \u2013 jig   that rhymes (2x) \nBoat \u2013 car   no way  (2x)\nSilly \u2013 Willy   that rhymes (2x)\n\n        Repeat Chorus  \n\nBug \u2013 hug   that rhymes (2x) \nTeacher \u2013 preacher  that rhymes (2x) \nHouse \u2013 truck   no way (2x)\n House \u2013 mouse  that rhymes (2x)\nTree \u2013 me   that rhymes (2x) \nEgg \u2013 chicken   no way (2x) \n\nJack Hartmann's website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/jackhartmann/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111246828015196865180/posts\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\nJack Hartmann Website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jack-hartmann/id391057562\nAmazon Mp3: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B00423GXF2?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=Jack%20Hartmann&index=digital-music&search-type=ss\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Jack_Hartmann?id=Ax3xg7dhdt5nx4b47dnwxjnhhhy&hl=en\nCD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M25S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1928331", "likeCount": "4542", "dislikeCount": "627", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "58"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/05qjc", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "5GG_Nsi2F9CTrn8QLJE-nr7GDF4", "id": "rjH76pVL8xA", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-06-17T02:05:44Z", "channelId": "UC1jhiDqp-jIYR07Ini8Jamw", "title": "Brain Break Song", "description": "This is the Brain Break Song by Have Fun Teaching!
