I put a new twist on this favorite children's song with fun characters (surfers, Hip-Hop singers) and creative silly movements (yucky style, spooky ghost style).\n\nBoom Chicka Boom is a wonderful \"repeat after me\" song can be used not only as a brain break in the classroom, but in physical education classes to get students moving and having fun.\n\nIn addition to using this for your brain breaks, Boom Chicka Boom highlights another educational skill, phonological awareness (reading skill)! All the ending sounds in Boom Chicka Boom sound alike except for Yo at the end. The yo was just for fun because children really like the pose.\n\nJames, my music partner, and I made the music in this version really rock! Your children will love the cool music and great beat to my new version of Boom Chicka Boom!\n\nI'm so happy to this song and video to your children and we thought it was important to include a beautiful diversity of children. They had lots of fun shooting this video, Boom Chicka Boom.\n\nBrain Breaks can be enjoyed in the classroom, physical education classes or at home!

All the ending sounds in Boom Chicka Boom sound alike except for Yo at the end. The yo was just for fun because children really like the pose.\n\nJames, my music partner, and I made the music in this version really rock!

That's good let's do another.\nThis time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.\nJust like a puppet string, it moves at your command.\nRight knee Up, down (4x) left knee Up, down (4x)\n\nChorus:\nKeep doing it, you got that right.\nThis hip hop stuff is out of sight.\nAnd now let's try a brand new thing.\nIn a while, right now let's sing.\nH to the I, I to the P that's hip; H to the O, O to the P that's hop. It's hip hop.\n\nFan with your hands, cool down your face.\nKeep doing this and keep the pace.\nTake giant steps to the right and left.\nNow back up and retrace your steps and stop.\n\nChorus\n\nPoint your toes first in then out.\nAnd that will move you all about.\nNow raise your arms. Swing them around\nSide to side, up and down, now stop.\n\nChorus\n\nStand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat.\nNow bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat.\nAdd your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat.\nMake your way back up, that move is complete.\n\nChorus\n\nHands on your knees now jump real small. It looks just like your sliding.\nJump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and\nUse your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!\nA \"Y\" hand means whatever, and an open hand means STOP!\n\nChorus\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20O8_XXiWFY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20O8_XXiWFY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20O8_XXiWFY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20O8_XXiWFY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20O8_XXiWFY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "TheLearningStation - Kids Songs and Nursery Rhymes", "tags": ["brain break", "brain breaks", "brain breaks for children", "brain breaks in the classroom", "brain breaks elementary", "brain breaks for kindergarten", "brain breaks dance", "children's dance songs", "kids dance song", "hip hop dance song for children", "clean hip hop for kids", "the learning station", "children songs", "kids songs", "music for kids", "children's music", "songs for kids", "song for kids", "kids music", "preschool", "kindergarten", "elementary", "dance", "kids", "children", "song", "songs", "classroom", "lyrics"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Brain Breaks - Children's Dance Song - Hip Hop Fast - Kid's Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "This popular children's brain breaks, dance song, Hip Hop (Fast) is from the award-winning CD, You Can Dance! \nYou Can Dance!

I'm here to show you whereupon,\nI say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.\nPalms down, the points of your fingers face each other.\nLift up and push down. That's good let's do another.\nThis time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.\nJust like a puppet string, it moves at your command.\nRight knee Up, down (4x) left knee Up, down (4x)\n\nChorus:\nKeep doing it, you got that right.\nThis hip hop stuff is out of sight.\nAnd now let's try a brand new thing.\nIn a while, right now let's sing.\nH to the I, I to the P that's hip; H to the O, O to the P that's hop. It's hip hop.\n\nFan with your hands, cool down your face.\nKeep doing this and keep the pace.\nTake giant steps to the right and left.\nNow back up and retrace your steps and stop.\n\nChorus\n\nPoint your toes first in then out.\nAnd that will move you all about.\nNow raise your arms. Swing them around\nSide to side, up and down, now stop.\n\nChorus\n\nStand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat.\nNow bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat.\nAdd your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat.\nMake your way back up, that move is complete.\n\nChorus\n\nHands on your knees now jump real small. It looks just like your sliding.\nJump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and\nUse your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!\nA \"Y\" hand means whatever, and an open hand means STOP!\n\nChorus\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M17S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "748475", "likeCount": "970", "dislikeCount": "385", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "24"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/0glt670", "/m/04rlf", "/m/0glt670"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "TVey6LKwlEZdXqo9FPknW7SL7so", "id": "bNsbcdmmgbM", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-05-04T19:42:14Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Brain Breaks - Sing & Dance Action Songs - Wadlee Atcha - Kids Action Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "\u201cWadlee Atcha\u201d is a popular children\u2019s brain breaks, action and dance song for kids. \u201cWadlee Atcha\u201d is from the award-winning CD, \u201cBrain Boogie Boosters\u201d. \nBrain Boogie Boosters CD Download: http://store.learningstationmusic.com/brainboogieboostersdownload.aspx\nBrain Boogie Boosters CD: http://store.learningstationmusic.com/brainboogieboosters.aspx\nFREE Brain Boosting Music and Movement printable activity sheets: http://learningstationmusic.com/docs/BrainBoostingMusicColor.pdf\n\nSUBSRIBE to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLearningStation\nLIKE us on Facebook and participate in FREE giveaways galore: http://www.facebook.com/LearningStationMusic\n\nBrain Breaks - Sing & Dance Action Songs for Children - Wadlee Atcha- Kids Action Songs by The Learning: Wadlee Atcha is a great brain break, action song and dance song for children.
