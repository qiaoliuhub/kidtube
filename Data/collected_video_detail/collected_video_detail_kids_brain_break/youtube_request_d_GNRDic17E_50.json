I purposefully made the song have a great beat, but not too fast, so little ones could more easily follow the dance moves and freeze with success.  \n\nSo, take a brain break when you need it and have fun doing the Bop Stop.\n\nLyrics\nYou can move to the beat\nShake your hands and your feet \nDo the Bop Stop\n\nYou can dance all around\nMove your body to the sound\nDo the Bop Stop\n\nYou can boogie, really move\nYou can twist really move\nYou can jump do the bop\nBut don't move when I stop\n\nYou can wiggle way down low\nLet your body really go\nDo the Bop Stop\n\nYou can dance really cool\nLet your body really move\nDo the Bop Stop\n\nYou can boogie, really move\nYou can twist really move\nYou can jump do the bop\nBut don't move when I stop\n\nYou can move to the beat\nShake your hands and your feet \nDo the Bop Stop\nDo the Bop Stop"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M39S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "154345", "likeCount": "320", "dislikeCount": "53", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sLkjxDUKRuilWjzNSUVCTdrAl8w", "id": "fkdFe3os3hc", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-05-12T21:50:23Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Online Class #38 for Kids \u266b Boom Chicka Boom Summer \u266b Brain Breaks \u266b Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "Online Class for Kids #38 by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station): Welcome to The Learning Station\u2019s online/virtual classroom for children.

This song inspires a child\u2019s natural curiosity to explore and learn about the world around them.  The Science Song is perfect for preschoolers, kindergarten and elementary age kids.  It is also a great ESL and EFL song for children.\n\nThe Science Song                                                                                                                                                                                          From the CD, Children Love to Sing and Dance                                                                                                                                           by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station)\n\u2117\u00a9Monopoli/The Learning Station \nLyrics:\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\n Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that\u2019s called migration, hibernation, migration.\nFrogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that\u2019s called hibernation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nEvaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn\u2019t last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can\u2019t see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nGravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nMetamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don\u2019t know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.

This song inspires a child\u2019s natural curiosity to explore and learn about the world around them.  The Science Song is perfect for preschoolers, kindergarten and elementary age kids.  It is also a great ESL and EFL song for children.\n\nThe Science Song                                                                                                                                                                                          From the CD, Children Love to Sing and Dance                                                                                                                                           by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station)\n\u2117\u00a9Monopoli/The Learning Station \nLyrics:\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\n Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that\u2019s called migration, hibernation, migration.\nFrogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that\u2019s called hibernation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nEvaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn\u2019t last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can\u2019t see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nGravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nMetamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don\u2019t know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.\n\nThis popular science song for kids inspires creativity, observation and imagination. \u201cThe Science Song\u201d is from the CD, Children Love to Sing and Dance.

The repetition  and rhyming in Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star is helpful in teaching kids how language development works. Kids love to sing and dance along with the Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star with all the characters they know and love.\n\nNursery Rhymes help with a child\u2019s language development. Kids hear and say vowel and letter sounds repeatedly throughout the song, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.   Nursery rhymes are filled with alliteration. As they sing a nursery rhyme they get a sense for rhythm and can help develop other important language skills such as inflection.\n \nNursery Rhymes are also important as they are often where a child hears a word for the first time, building their vocabulary. Nursery rhymes are also a great introduction to sentence and story structure because they are short and easy to remember, making them repeatable, too. Nursery rhymes are good for simple story telling as they usually have an identifiable beginning, middle and end. Kids easily memorize and recall the stories, especially when the nursery rhymes are set to music.\n\nNursery rhymes can build a child\u2019s imagination as they need to visualize and often act out scenes in the nursery rhymes. Humpty Dumpty is a great example. Nursery rhymes such as Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star can help kids with developing gross and fine motor movements.\n\nWhat you may not know is nursery rhymes can also help develop math skills as well. Many nursery rhymes involve the use of number, such as three blind mice, but also nursery rhymes rely on patterning and sequence. Math vocabulary words for measurement can also be introduced, for instance weight. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning.\n\nNursery rhymes also aid kids in developing socially as the characters in nursery rhymes are often portrayed in a variety of situations.
