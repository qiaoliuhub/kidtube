This is a great song to engage your children in movement and practicing how to count to 100. Also, this song is perfect to have some Zero the Hero fun to celebrate 100 days of school.\n\nThis count to 100 song features the popular fictional character Zero the Hero who flies in with Zeroes so children can count beyond the number 9. Zero the Hero places the zero (0) to hold the place for the tens (10's), hundreds (100's), thousands (1,000's) and on to infinity. Wow, those zeroes are important! Zero the Hero is a big, cool, super character that helps make math fun. At your school or home, anyone can dress up a little bit and have fun with playing the part of Zero the Hero.\n\nTeachers and parents all over the world do dress up as Zero the Hero to help children understand how important those zeroes (0's) are to hold the place for numbers to go beyond single digit numbers.\n\nSo, count to 100 and follow Zero the Hero while exercising, getting smarter, stronger and healthier.\n\nJust for your information, I wrote this song, but our, count to 100 Zero the Hero character, is played by our friend Mark. He was a good sport to do this, and is a really great guy. By the way, he really is that big! He bench presses almost 500 lbs, dose curls with 200 lbs, has 22 inch biceps and works out 2 hrs a day five days a week ! He's also a stay at home dad with 6 children.

This is a great song to engage your children in movement and practicing how to count to 100. Also, this song is perfect to have some Zero the Hero fun to celebrate 100 days of school.\n\nThis count to 100 song features the popular fictional character Zero the Hero who flies in with Zeroes so children can count beyond the number 9. Zero the Hero places the zero (0) to hold the place for the tens (10's), hundreds (100's), thousands (1,000's) and on to infinity. Wow, those zeroes are important! Zero the Hero is a big, cool, super character that helps make math fun. At your school or home, anyone can dress up a little bit and have fun with playing the part of Zero the Hero.\n\nTeachers and parents all over the world do dress up as Zero the Hero to help children understand how important those zeroes (0's) are to hold the place for numbers to go beyond single digit numbers.\n\nSo, count to 100 and follow Zero the Hero while exercising, getting smarter, stronger and healthier.\n\nJust for your information, I wrote this song, but our, count to 100 Zero the Hero character, is played by our friend Mark.

If your children like to move and jump or if they already do kids yoga, they will love RoboTots fitness adventures. \n\nLearn coordination, balance and build your child\u2019s confidence. Watch your children get better each time they complete new moves. If your kids are shy in group classes, start with RoboTots. This is a great way to have fun and develop skills right in your own home. Kids can be silly and jump around without the added pressure of other kids in the class or a new environment. \n\n15 fun and easy moves for your little kids who love Disney and Star Wars! This fun Star Wars workout will get your kids jumping and dancing. Watch the timer- Kids love to earn stars and diamonds as they complete each exercise move for 15 seconds.

The city of Batuu at Galaxys edge is so realistic. There are storm troopers, scoundrels and Jedi roaming around, so we must be very careful. The Star Wars learning adventure starts with the Millennium Falcon and we learn to count to 12 parsecs. Our preschool age son is a big Star Wars fan. First we took him on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disneyland Galaxys Edge. Next we found the Droid Depot at Star Wars land and learned how to build our very own droid. R-series or BB unit. We chose the R series like R2-D2. Learn about colors, pick your favorite parts and put it together. The activated droid communicates with other droids in Disneyland Star Wars land. Next we see a sign in a foreign language. We learn about Aurebesh the mythical language of Star Wars. We check out the milk stand. Have you ever tried blue or green milk? Watch how RoboDad drinks the milk. We had so much fun showing you around Disneyland Galaxy Edge for kids! We hope you enjoyed the educational adventure.
