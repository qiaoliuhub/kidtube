My feelings really do get hurt. I\u2019m angry. I feel so angry.\nWhen I build my blocks so high and someone knocks them down, I cry. I\u2019m angry. I feel so angry. \n\nCooperation is the way to make the angries go away. So talk, don\u2019t shout. Just work it out, and it\u2019s okay of you should say, \u201cI\u2019m angry. I feel so angry.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m angry. I feel so angry.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m angry. I feel so angry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m angry. I feel so angry.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m angry.

Subitizing develops math fluency, when students recognize sets without having to count each object and it helps develop number sense and the ability to perform mental math. Name the numbers in each set of dots, ten frames and fingers. This version  of Subitize Rock does not show the numerals after each set.\n\nLyrics\nSubitize, subitize\nUse your brain\nUse your eyes\nSee a set, then think quick\nSay the number in the set\n\n(Say the number of dots in each set)\n\nSubitize, subitize\nUse your brain\nUse your eyes\nSee a set, then think quick\nSay the number in the set\n\n(Say the number in the ten frames)\n\nSubitize, subitize\nUse your brain\nUse your eyes\nSee a set, then think quick\nSay the number in the set\n\n(Say the number of fingers)\n\nSubitize, subitize\nUse your brain\nUse your eyes\nSee a set, then think quick\nSay the number in the set\n\nJack Hartmann's website: www.jackhartmann.com\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: www.pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle +: plus.google.com/u/0/111246828015196865180\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: www.jackhartmann.com\niTunes: itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jack-hartmann/id391057562\nAmazon Mp3: amazon.com/Boom-Chicka/dp/artist-redirect/B0156RBPXW/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1492528781&sr=1-1&keywords=Jack+Hartmann\nGoogle Play: play.google.com/store/music/artist/Jack_Hartmann?id=Ax3xg7dhdt5nx4b47dnwxjnhhhy&hl=en\nCD Baby: www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M23S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2214359", "likeCount": "4037", "dislikeCount": "643", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "59"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "-h7N2RvcOzw7mbqSt3CDlTqBh80", "id": "X7jSWdnoshw", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-09-06T14:12:20Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Jump Up, Bend Down \u266b Exercise Song for Kids \u266b Action Dance Song \u266b Kids Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "\u201cJump Up, Bend Down \u201d exercise song for kids is a popular brain break, action and dance song for children sung by Don Monopoli of The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station). \u201cJump Up, Bend Down\u201d song\u201d is from the CD, \u201cLA DI DA, LA DI DI, Dance with Me.\n \u266b LA DI DA, LA DI DI, Dance with Me CD Download: https://store.learningstationmusic.com/ladidaladididancewithmedownload.aspx\n\u266b LA DI DA, LA DI DI, Dance with Me CD:  https://store.learningstationmusic.com/ladidaladididancewithme.aspx\n\u201cJump Up, Bend Down \u201cexercise song for kids is by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station)!
