Why do we regroup in subtraction?\nA. In a subtraction problem, you need to regroup if there are not enough ones or tens to subtract.\n\nQ. What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 4th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS2 (Year 4-5) \n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1.

check out our growing library of award-winning math video animations at https://www.numberock.com  \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThank you for watching our Halloween Night Song For Kids.\n\n \u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nQ. Why do we celebrate Halloween.\nA. The practices of Halloween mostly come from Celtic paganism in the British Isles, and their feast of Samhain, the new year. They believed it was the time when ghosts and spirits came out to haunt, and the Celts would appease the spirits by giving them treats.\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.

Why do we celebrate Halloween.\nA. The practices of Halloween mostly come from Celtic paganism in the British Isles, and their feast of Samhain, the new year. They believed it was the time when ghosts and spirits came out to haunt, and the Celts would appease the spirits by giving them treats.\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.

The repetition in Peas Porridge is helpful in teaching kids how language works. Kids love to sing and dance along with the Peas Porridge with all the characters they know and love.\n\nNursery Rhymes help with a child\u2019s language development. Kids hear and say vowel and letter sounds repeatedly throughout the song, Peas Porridge.   Nursery rhymes are filled with alliteration. As they sing a nursery rhyme they get a sense for rhythm and can help develop other important language skills such as inflection. \n\nNursery Rhymes are also important as they are often where a child hears a word for the first time, building their vocabulary. Nursery rhymes are also a great introduction to sentence and story structure because they are short and easy to remember, making them repeatable, too. Nursery rhymes are good for simple story telling as they usually have an identifiable beginning, middle and end. Kids easily memorize and recall the stories, especially when the nursery rhymes are set to music.\n\nNursery rhymes can build a child\u2019s imagination as they need to visualize and often act out scenes in the nursery rhymes. Humpty Dumpty is a great example. Nursery rhymes such as Peas Porridge can help kids with developing gross and fine motor movements.\n\nWhat you may not know is nursery rhymes can also help develop math skills as well. Many nursery rhymes involve the use of number, such as three blind mice, but also nursery rhymes rely on patterning and sequence. Math vocabulary words for measurement can also be introduced, for instance weight. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning.\n\nNursery rhymes also aid kids in developing socially as the characters in nursery rhymes are often portrayed in a variety of situations.
