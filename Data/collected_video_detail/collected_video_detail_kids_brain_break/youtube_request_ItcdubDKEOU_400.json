If your children like to move and jump or if they already do kids yoga, they will love RoboTots fitness adventures. \n\nLearn coordination, balance and build your child\u2019s confidence. Watch your children get better each time they complete new moves. If your kids are shy in group classes, start with RoboTots. This is a great way to have fun and develop skills right in your own home. Kids can be silly and jump around without the added pressure of other kids in the class or a new environment. \n\n15 fun and easy moves for your little kids who love Disney and Star Wars! This fun Star Wars workout will get your kids jumping and dancing. Watch the timer- Kids love to earn stars and diamonds as they complete each exercise move for 15 seconds.

The city of Batuu at Galaxys edge is so realistic. There are storm troopers, scoundrels and Jedi roaming around, so we must be very careful. The Star Wars learning adventure starts with the Millennium Falcon and we learn to count to 12 parsecs. Our preschool age son is a big Star Wars fan. First we took him on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disneyland Galaxys Edge. Next we found the Droid Depot at Star Wars land and learned how to build our very own droid. R-series or BB unit. We chose the R series like R2-D2. Learn about colors, pick your favorite parts and put it together. The activated droid communicates with other droids in Disneyland Star Wars land. Next we see a sign in a foreign language. We learn about Aurebesh the mythical language of Star Wars. We check out the milk stand. Have you ever tried blue or green milk? Watch how RoboDad drinks the milk. We had so much fun showing you around Disneyland Galaxy Edge for kids! We hope you enjoyed the educational adventure.

Sure worksheet practice is part of the process, but our video will bring another part to that: fun visuals and examples to help children see the pattern to spelling.  That way they will be ready for the spelling test!  We use fun, fancy clipart to bring together our electronic program.  It's for the beginner, early primary grade spellers, typically a 6 year old or under.  And remember, early spelling is not always about being correct, but listening for the acceptable sounds they hear (e.g. \"bat\" might be \"bt\" \"bet\" or even just \"b\").  The words you select should be a challenge level of medium without frustration, and practice throughout the week as you would any skill you want to improve.  If the child is having trouble hearing sounds in words, switch to a visual style as that might be a stronger way of processing for that particular kid.\n\nOur goal at Mr. B's Brain is to use YouTube as an enrichment for school.  We aim to help each student with animated learning opportunities.  We have gotten feedback that our lessons are effective for the toddler all the way to the adult - as it helps moms and dads learn how to teach their students in better ways.  We've done a patient search of video Youtube content, surveyed teachers, looked at what was effective in the classroom, analyzed lesson plans, and then came to create what you see before you.  We are proud of our free high resolution short videos that are a great tool to join with a traditional education.  You have our permission to use them in your home, preschool, kindergarten class, first grade classroom, or anywhere else you'd like to.

Sure worksheet practice is part of the process, but our video will bring another part to that: fun visuals and examples to help children see the pattern to spelling.  That way they will be ready for the spelling test!  We use fun, fancy clipart to bring together our electronic program.  It's for the beginner, early primary grade spellers, typically a 6 year old or under.  And remember, early spelling is not always about being correct, but listening for the acceptable sounds they hear (e.g. \"bat\" might be \"bt\" \"bet\" or even just \"b\").  The words you select should be a challenge level of medium without frustration, and practice throughout the week as you would any skill you want to improve.  If the child is having trouble hearing sounds in words, switch to a visual style as that might be a stronger way of processing for that particular kid.\n\nOur goal at Mr. B's Brain is to use YouTube as an enrichment for school.  We aim to help each student with animated learning opportunities.  We have gotten feedback that our lessons are effective for the toddler all the way to the adult - as it helps moms and dads learn how to teach their students in better ways.  We've done a patient search of video Youtube content, surveyed teachers, looked at what was effective in the classroom, analyzed lesson plans, and then came to create what you see before you.

Kids really have fun when they count big numbers like counting by 100 to 1000.   Teachers can extend this count by 100's to 1,000 skill by introducing the importance of the number zero.  You can discuss how the zeroes hold the place value for the tens, hundreds and thousands.  This song is so bright and upbeat your children will want to sing it all the time, and they'll really understand how to count by 100's all the way to 1,000.\n\n\nLYRICS: \n \nChorus (x1)                \nI like to count big numbers,\nI like to count by hundreds,\nI like to count big numbers,\nC\u2019mon join me now, \n \nOne hundred, two hundred, three hundred,\nFour hundred, five hundred, six hundred,\nSeven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred,\nOne thousand!\n\nLet's do it again!\n \n(Repeat counting by hundreds)\n \nRepeat Chorus and Counting\n\nJack Hartmann's website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/jackhartmann/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111246828015196865180/posts\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\nJack Hartmann Website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jack-hartmann/id391057562\nAmazon Mp3: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B00423GXF2?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=Jack%20Hartmann&index=digital-music&search-type=ss\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Jack_Hartmann?id=Ax3xg7dhdt5nx4b47dnwxjnhhhy&hl=en\nCD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M17S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "153362", "likeCount": "589", "dislikeCount": "122", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "OL2NyadGy5Uw5JQJU1x7EYKYkHY", "id": "w3kcYN3yTlo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-04-30T13:21:36Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Boom Chicka Boom Mother\u2019s Day \u266b + More Best Kids Songs \u266b 10 Best Kids Songs \u266b The Learning Station", "description": "Boom Chicka Boom Mother\u2019s Day Song for Kids by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station)!
