Rhyming awareness and listening for rhymes is so important in language development for the young child.\n  \nChildren who are able to distinguish different sounds and phonemes are more likely to develop stronger literacy skills over time (Ehri et al. 2001). Music supports this critical skill because songs include rhyming or substituting one sound for another (US Dept. of Health and Human Services).\n\nChildren can follow me in my dance moves and repeat after me rhyming lines.  This movement and rhyming song is wonderful for a fun and effective brain breaks activity.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nThe Echo Dance\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nWith your hips, with your arms, with your hands\nFollow me, do the Echo Dance\n\nDo the twist, just like this                       (children repeat each line)\nDo the shake, it's a piece of cake\nDo the hop, don't you stop\nDo the swing, it's a groovy thing\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nWith your hips, with your arms, with your hands\nFollow me, do the Echo Dance\n\nDo the stomp, you can really romp\nDo the choo choo train, right down the lane\nDo the swim, like you've got fins\nDo the monkey, it's really funky\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e9FNz80g_7Y\n\nFilmed at Suite 4K Studios:\nhttp://www.suite4k.com/\n\nThis video made possible thanks to the support of the St. Petersburg, Clearwater Film Commission Digital Creator Studio program:\nhttp://www.filmspc.com/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "75376", "likeCount": "158", "dislikeCount": "31", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "o-Fj9emgoc7WJFbeaMmERewC7QY", "id": "f1RPWBUeCXs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-03-25T12:23:20Z", "channelId": "UCMVDIgXkSHq0s4PzUNr9ZhA", "title": "Busy Brain Breaks #13", "description": "", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Busy Brain Breaks", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Busy Brain Breaks #13", "description": ""}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M13S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "98", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/027x7n", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/027x7n", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"]}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 50, "resultsPerPage": 50}}
