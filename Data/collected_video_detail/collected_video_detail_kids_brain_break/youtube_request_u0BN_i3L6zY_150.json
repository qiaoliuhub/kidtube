Rhyming awareness and listening for rhymes is so important in language development for the young child.\n  \nChildren who are able to distinguish different sounds and phonemes are more likely to develop stronger literacy skills over time (Ehri et al. 2001). Music supports this critical skill because songs include rhyming or substituting one sound for another (US Dept. of Health and Human Services).\n\nChildren can follow me in my dance moves and repeat after me rhyming lines.  This movement and rhyming song is wonderful for a fun and effective brain breaks activity.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nThe Echo Dance\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nWith your hips, with your arms, with your hands\nFollow me, do the Echo Dance\n\nDo the twist, just like this                       (children repeat each line)\nDo the shake, it's a piece of cake\nDo the hop, don't you stop\nDo the swing, it's a groovy thing\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nWith your hips, with your arms, with your hands\nFollow me, do the Echo Dance\n\nDo the stomp, you can really romp\nDo the choo choo train, right down the lane\nDo the swim, like you've got fins\nDo the monkey, it's really funky\n\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\nLet's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e9FNz80g_7Y\n\nFilmed at Suite 4K Studios:\nhttp://www.suite4k.com/\n\nThis video made possible thanks to the support of the St. Petersburg, Clearwater Film Commission Digital Creator Studio program:\nhttp://www.filmspc.com/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "75376", "likeCount": "158", "dislikeCount": "31", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "o-Fj9emgoc7WJFbeaMmERewC7QY", "id": "f1RPWBUeCXs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-03-25T12:23:20Z", "channelId": "UCMVDIgXkSHq0s4PzUNr9ZhA", "title": "Busy Brain Breaks #13", "description": "", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1RPWBUeCXs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Busy Brain Breaks", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Busy Brain Breaks #13", "description": ""}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M13S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "98", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/027x7n", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/027x7n", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "H_WZzd5tL2N5lbV8d0dTmw1xDBc", "id": "SHdnJVXTfwc", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-05-03T06:59:18Z", "channelId": "UCalp9JET2YKGZQTD2hpyUBQ", "title": "BRAIN BREAK ACTIVITY IP day 5", "description": "", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHdnJVXTfwc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHdnJVXTfwc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHdnJVXTfwc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHdnJVXTfwc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHdnJVXTfwc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Trinityhouse Little Falls Physical Education", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "BRAIN BREAK ACTIVITY IP day 5", "description": ""}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M41S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "230", "likeCount": "9", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/027x7n", "/m/019_rr", "/m/019_rr", "/m/027x7n"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "bm_x9h2gqc4gCdQhpFvJeyjf9S4", "id": "wu--9fOkOJM", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-05-12T14:23:05Z", "channelId": "UCIX_dbLC_bbHXksbZyuPdQQ", "title": "Level Up 2!

(Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nThat's what Tony knows.

(Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)\nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)\nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)\nAnd there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)\nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)\nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n**************************\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!

(Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nTony knows.  Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) \nTony Chestnut knows I love you. (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nThat's what Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.)                                                          \nTony, Tony and his sister Eileen.  (Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)\nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)\nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)\nAnd there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)\nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)\nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n**************************\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!

Songs and chants are a natural way to develop oral language and auditory memory.\n\n6. Poems and songs lay a foundation for fluency and enhance short term memory.\n\n7. Children are able to use their imaginations and create pictures in their brains when they sing.  This is an important part of reading comprehension.\n\n 8. Repetition is a key to learning.
