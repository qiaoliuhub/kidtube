If you would like to use this calming music for children for commercial purposes contact us at blanketbarricade@gmail.com\n\nOur slow relaxing videos are especially created to relax and calm down kids and children who are in the classroom trying to learn and study. Teachers can put on this music after giving instructions while the students and are doing their work or reading. The music will focus childen and dissuade them from talking to each other while working. It can also be played for younger children during naptime and quiet reading & writing time. The music can also be used while students are listening to the teacher but just be sure to turn volume down even more during this time. The music can be used for any age including for preschoolers, elementary students, middle schoolers and children in kindergarten classrooms.\n\nThis relaxing kids music is intended to inspire kids to learn efficiently as they will be focused solely on working on their homework.  The music is also created with positivity in mind and keeps a perfect balance between being too relaxed and too awake. The music is composed at a slow relaxing tempo and is mixed at a low volume.  \n\nTo get the full impact of this quiet relaxation music put the music on at a relatively low volume. Be sure to place your stereo system in a way so that the music frequencies don't make any rattling sounds. Played to a young audience of inquiring minds this chill music will be the perfect learning aid for a tranquil and quiet classroom.  This music is fully instrumental and is 100% safe and clean for the school.\n\nThis calm music for kids is composed using the latest music creation technology. Soft tones and ambient sounds are melded together with beautiful piano, soft chilled out hand percussion sounds and high fidelity sampled synthesizers. This quiet time music for the classroom has also been tested in a French immersion classroom in Canada where a group of 25 grade two's listened to the music for every day for a week. In addition to the teacher reporting lower stress for herself she said that the students were better behaved, more positive in their interactions and generally more focused on learning while the music was playing. A number of students around the world have also tested the music at home as study music and have generally found it useful for them in making their study and homework time more enjoyable.\n\nIf this relaxing music for kids helps your class or child to learn better or to relax please leave a comment below letting us know.

You can stream it for free on YouTube, but also buy it at my website.  I am already offering 50+ of my hip educational songs/videos on YouTube FOR FREE at youtube.com/harrykindergarten.  Enjoy them, utilize them, and share them!  I am a current full-time Kindergarten teacher so I know what it's like to be looking around for quality content in my classroom!  You can ALSO purchase the raw video file and/or audio file of those 50+ songs at my website (if you need them for some reason).  I will continue to make freebie videos (ones you can just stream on YouTube for free) periodically, so continue to check back to see if I've posted any.  \n\n*Please DO NOT rip any of my videos off of YouTube and upload them to your YouTube channel.  I want the Harry Kindergarten Music channel to be the hotspot for these videos, not random teachers' channels who happened to illegally take them off of mine.  If you really want to have a playlist of them, create a playlist from MY channel or purchase them on my website so you have the raw files.  THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING!\n\n\nFAQ's:\n\nQ: Who is Mr. Harry?\nA: I am Pete Harry.  First name Pete.  Last name Harry.  I am the founder & content creator for Harry Kindergarten Music, LLC.  Check out ALL of my links at the bottom!   I am a full-time Kindergarten teacher in Bellwood, PA and live w/ my beautiful wife, Jen and 2 young children, Justice (daughter) & Paxton (son).  To clarify, I am NOT Jack Hartmann, but I do love his stuff!  You should check out his website too- www.jackhartmann.com.  I am NOT Mark D. Pencil, but I have partnered w/ him before to make videos for his songs- check out his website too- www.markdpencil.com!\n\nQ: When is my favorite Harry Kindergarten video coming back???????!!!!!!\nA: I am slowly, but surely re-making most of my Harry Kindergarten videos.  If there was a particular video that you loved from several years ago and it's not  back up yet, be patient and it may re-appear in time!   As mentioned earlier, I am a full-time teacher, place a HIGH value on my family & values, and am extremely busy, so it might just take a little bit of time until you see your \"old favorite\" pop back up again.  Changing my kids' diapers and taking them to the playground comes before re-making videos, but if you are reallllllllllllly desperate, email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com or inquire at my Facebook group page and make a request so I have it on my radar screen.  I am NOT remaking old Jack Hartmann videos, but Jack IS and you can find those as HE remakes them and posts them at his YouTube page: www.youtube.com/jackhartmann.  \n\nQ: Can my class perform a \"Harry Kindergarten song\" for an audience?\nA: If you desire to have your class or group of students perform one of my \u201cHarry Kindergarten\u201d songs for an audience, please note that there is a $6.00 PERFORMANCE FEE.\n\nHere are some hypothetical examples of performance groups:\n* Students perform a song for an audience during a graduation ceremony.\n* Students perform a song for an audience during a school or community talent show.\n* Students perform a song for an audience during a school assembly.\nIf you are unsure if you need to purchase a performance license or not, please inquire at: pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com.

You can stream it for free on YouTube, but also buy it at my website.  I am already offering 50+ of my hip educational songs/videos on YouTube FOR FREE at youtube.com/harrykindergarten.  Enjoy them, utilize them, and share them!  I am a current full-time Kindergarten teacher so I know what it's like to be looking around for quality content in my classroom!  You can ALSO purchase the raw video file and/or audio file of those 50+ songs at my website (if you need them for some reason).  I will continue to make freebie videos (ones you can just stream on YouTube for free) periodically, so continue to check back to see if I've posted any.  \n\n*Please DO NOT rip any of my videos off of YouTube and upload them to your YouTube channel.  I want the Harry Kindergarten Music channel to be the hotspot for these videos, not random teachers' channels who happened to illegally take them off of mine.  If you really want to have a playlist of them, create a playlist from MY channel or purchase them on my website so you have the raw files.  THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING!\n\n\nFAQ's:\n\nQ: Who is Mr. Harry?\nA: I am Pete Harry.  First name Pete.  Last name Harry.  I am the founder & content creator for Harry Kindergarten Music, LLC.  Check out ALL of my links at the bottom!   I am a full-time Kindergarten teacher in Bellwood, PA and live w/ my beautiful wife, Jen and 2 young children, Justice (daughter) & Paxton (son).  To clarify, I am NOT Jack Hartmann, but I do love his stuff!  You should check out his website too- www.jackhartmann.com.  I am NOT Mark D. Pencil, but I have partnered w/ him before to make videos for his songs- check out his website too- www.markdpencil.com!\n\nQ: When is my favorite Harry Kindergarten video coming back???????!!!!!!\nA: I am slowly, but surely re-making most of my Harry Kindergarten videos.  If there was a particular video that you loved from several years ago and it's not  back up yet, be patient and it may re-appear in time!   As mentioned earlier, I am a full-time teacher, place a HIGH value on my family & values, and am extremely busy, so it might just take a little bit of time until you see your \"old favorite\" pop back up again.
