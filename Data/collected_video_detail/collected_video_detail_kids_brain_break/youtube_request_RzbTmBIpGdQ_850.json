All these skills are very important developmental skills for young children. \nThis pirate song for kids continues to be one of my most popular original songs. Children really use their imaginations as they act out each character's part. There are movements and lots of repetition to build brain and body connections.\nTeachers and Parents can extend the learning after the video by asking these questions. \nWho is your favorite character?\nCan you tell me what order the characters appear in?\nHow many characters did you see?\nWhat is the setting of the story?\nThe simple rhythm and great melody of Silly Pirate Song continues to make this pirate song for kids a favorite of children around the world.\n\nLYRICS:\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate, a surfer came along\n\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026Yo, ho, ho, hee,hee, hee\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nHey dude surfs up\nA pirate\u2019s life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate a big shark came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026Yo, ho, ho ho, hee, hee, hee\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate \nA helicopter came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026 Yo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nSwoosh, swoosh\n Chomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nShoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate \nAn octopus came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026 Yo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nWiggle wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp,\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nWiggle wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp,\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate \nA submarine came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle \nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle \nSwoosh,swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate \nA singing mermaid came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026 Yo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nLa, La, la\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, hee, hee, hee\nLa, La, la\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude, surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\n\nOnce there was a pirate who sang a pirate song\nThen interrupting the pirate \nA police boat came along\nYou\u2019d hear\u2026\nYo,ho,ho,hee,hee,hee\nStop-freeze\nLa,la,la\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nYo, ho, ho, ho, hee hee, hee\nA pirate's life for me\nStop-freeze\nLa,la,la\nUp periscope\nWiggle, wiggle\nSwoosh, swoosh\nChomp, chomp\nHey dude surfs up\nA pirate's life for me\nA pirate's life is\u2026not for me!\nThere are too many interruptions!\n\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M5S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1797951", "likeCount": "3570", "dislikeCount": "707", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "31"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "7r2GVY88hzwC-VQUYuK6Dl1FMzg", "id": "OMg6t-z8KEI", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-03-26T20:30:00Z", "channelId": "UCVcQH8A634mauPrGbWs7QlQ", "title": "Greet Someone Without Touching | Greet From 6 Feet | Jack Hartmann Social Distancing Song", "description": "Jack Hartmann shows helpful ways to greet someone from 6 feet.

The melody and rhythm are so catchy that the counting by 100's will simply stick in their brain, and they'll always remember.  Your children will sing along and they will want to dance along, too, to this upbeat, cool tune.  Counting by 100's to 1000 will be a self-esteem builder, too, because they will feel so good knowing they can count up so high.   Kids really have fun when they count big numbers like counting by 100 to 1000.   Teachers can extend this count by 100's to 1,000 skill by introducing the importance of the number zero.  You can discuss how the zeroes hold the place value for the tens, hundreds and thousands.  This song is so bright and upbeat your children will want to sing it all the time, and they'll really understand how to count by 100's all the way to 1,000.\n\n\nLYRICS: \n \nChorus (x1)                \nI like to count big numbers,\nI like to count by hundreds,\nI like to count big numbers,\nC\u2019mon join me now, \n \nOne hundred, two hundred, three hundred,\nFour hundred, five hundred, six hundred,\nSeven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred,\nOne thousand!\n\nLet's do it again!\n \n(Repeat counting by hundreds)\n \nRepeat Chorus and Counting\n\nJack Hartmann's website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/jackhartmann/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111246828015196865180/posts\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\nJack Hartmann Website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jack-hartmann/id391057562\nAmazon Mp3: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B00423GXF2?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=Jack%20Hartmann&index=digital-music&search-type=ss\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Jack_Hartmann?id=Ax3xg7dhdt5nx4b47dnwxjnhhhy&hl=en\nCD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5v-aDFOmTBc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5v-aDFOmTBc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5v-aDFOmTBc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5v-aDFOmTBc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5v-aDFOmTBc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Jack Hartmann Kids Music Channel", "tags": ["jack hartmann", "Counting By 100's", "count to 1000", "count by 100's to 100", "counting by 100 to 1000", "skip counting by 100's to 1000", "counting by 100", "count by 100s", "counting by 100 to 1000 song", "counting by 100s", "skip counting by 100", "counting by 100 song", "counting in 100s", "counting by 100s song", "counting by hundreds", "count by 100", "counting in 100s song", "counting to 100", "count to 100", "skip counting by 100 song", "count by 100 to 1000", "count by 100's", "skip count by 100"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Learning to Count | Counting By 100's | Brain Breaks | Kid's Songs | Jack Hartmann", "description": "This super fun count by 100's song will really help your children learn how to count by 100's to 1,000.
