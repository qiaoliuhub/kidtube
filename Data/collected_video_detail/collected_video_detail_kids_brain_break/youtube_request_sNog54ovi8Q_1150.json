It's one of my favorites because it engages children in creative active movement. Jack Hartmann clearly and accurately says each letter sound and a word that begins with that letter to act out. \n\nAct Out the Alphabet aligns with the Common Core standard for Phonics, (ccss.ela-literacy.RF.K.3a).

Cross lateral movements are movements that cross the midline of the brain.The midline is an imaginary line that runs down the middle of the body from head to toes, dividing the body into right and left halves. When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the midline. Crossing midline activities promote communication between the two hemispheres of the brain.  \n\nCrossover tells children exactly what part of the body to crossover from right to left and left to right. Crossover is very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.\n\nCrossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right.

When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the midline. Crossing midline activities promote communication between the two hemispheres of the brain.  \n\nCrossover tells children exactly what part of the body to crossover from right to left and left to right. Crossover is very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.\n\nCrossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right. When we engage children in crossover movements blood flow is increased in all parts of the brain making it more alert and energized for optimal learning.\n\nUse this song as a great musical brain breaks activity for stimulating the brain and body.\n\nLYRICS:\nCrossover\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann, MA  BMI  Copyright 2008\n\nRight hand to your left shoulder\nLeft hand to your right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your left knee\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to the left elbow\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nCrossover as you walk\nArms left then to the right\nCrossover as you stretch\nReach out side to side\nCrossover, as you move\nTwist left then to the right\nCrossover builds your body and brain \nAnd helps you read and write\n\nRight hand to your left ear\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your left foot\nLeft hand to your right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your friend\u2019s right\nLeft hand to their left\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nCrossover as you walk\nArms left then to the right\nCrossover as you stretch\nReach out side to side\nCrossover, as you move\nTwist left then to the right\nCrossover builds your body and brain \nAnd helps you read and write\n\nExerSongs: https://www.jackhartmann.com/album/physical-education-exersongs/\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2020\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M6S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "109619", "likeCount": "649", "dislikeCount": "81", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "fK6xltWa5rKEuklXejUD-SnX648", "id": "3nxX1nWTE1A", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-05-14T17:54:09Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Boom Chicka Boom \ud83c\udf93 Graduation Song for Kids \ud83c\udf93 Action, Dance Kids Songs \ud83c\udf93 The Learning Station", "description": "Boom Chicka Boom Graduation Song for Kids, Preschool & Kindergarten: #1 Best kids preschool and kindergarten thank you graduation song, action and dance song for children!

I'm here to show you whereupon,\nI say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.\nPalms down, the points of your fingers face each other.\nLift up and push down. That's good let's do another.\nThis time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.\nJust like a puppet string, it moves at your command.\nRight knee Up, down (4x) left knee Up, down (4x)\n\nChorus:\nKeep doing it, you got that right.\nThis hip hop stuff is out of sight.\nAnd now let's try a brand new thing.\nIn a while, right now let's sing.\nH to the I, I to the P that's hip; H to the O, O to the P that's hop.

We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.\nAway, Away, Away\nHe gave it to a farmer, said he'd take it to a farm.\nThe farmer drove the tractor with the cat under his arm.\nHe dropped it in a cornfield, thought he'd surely get lost.\nThe cat ate up the cornfield at the farmer's cost.\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back. We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.\nAway, Away, Away\nHe gave it to a trucker that was going to Mexico.\nThe trucker stopped for coffee at a \"Trucker Stop & Go\".\nBut while he was a' paying he knew that he was stuck\nHe saw the cat jump in the cab and take off with his truck.\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back. We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.\nAway, Away, Away\nHe gave it to a pilot with a real nice plane.\nThe pilot could just fly it far away in one day.\nBut the pilot had his troubles he couldn't touch down.\nBecause the cat had the controls and made the pilot turn around.\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back. We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.\nAway, Away, Away\nHe gave it to a train conductor, put it on a train\nNew England's where the train was headed up to Bangor Maine\nHe pull down on the brakes those wheels screeched on the track\nAnd as it ran away, conductor said, \"Here, kitty cat\".\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back. We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.\nAway, Away, Away                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe cat was taken in by a lovely little girl\nShe loved that yellow cat, she made that cat her world\nNow there is no reason for the cat to come back\nCuz it never has to leave and it likes it like that.\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back.
