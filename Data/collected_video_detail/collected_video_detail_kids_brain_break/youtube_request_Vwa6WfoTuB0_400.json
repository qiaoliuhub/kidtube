With actions and movement to suit every child\u2019s ability.\n\nSing along with kindyRock creator Judi Cranston and her young friend Imogen, as she takes you through simple actions of 5 favourites animals and the way they move their bodies. The tempo gets slower at the end too, making this so much fun to sing along to.

Children love to sing and dance to their own songs as well as kindyRock songs.\n\nIf you have landed on this Youtube channel it\u2019s probably because you are a teacher to children aged under 7 years, you've heard about us through a school, kindergarten, daycare, yoga or music class, you're an in home educator or a parent who understands the importance of music education for children's development.  \n\nAt kindyRock we want to help support you in your teaching by providing you with Quality Music Education Resources.\n\nAs a teacher you will probably know how important and effective music is for our children\u2019s brains and that you should be doing music regularly, even on a daily basis in your classes!

You can incorporate and encourage your children to join in which also helps them with rhythm and is perfect for brain breaks, circle time, group activities or those bad weather days when children can't go outside to play.\n\nSidney the Snake  is also easy and fun to play or pretend to play when you need a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh, they can then return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed.
