Children see the movements and follow along.  Kids hear and see the clapping pattern, clap along to the pattern and move their body. \n\nClapping Machine really helps your children listen carefully for the auditory queues and visual clapping pattern and see the dance movements. They have a chance to follow me exactly, as I show them the clapping pattern and the movement. The repetition in this brain breaks song is wonderful for young children as it helps them to anticipate the auditory pattern and movement. Recognizing patterns like the ones in my song, and in the world around us builds critical math and reading skills. \n\nTaking brain breaks is very helpful for children to do their best schoolwork.  Music, movement and fun allows them to refresh and recharge their brain and body.
