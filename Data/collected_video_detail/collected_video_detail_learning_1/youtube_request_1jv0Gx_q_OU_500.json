This Alphabet song in our Let\u2019s Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the vowel a.  \n\nYour children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they\u2019ll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.\nThis letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.\nAll of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.\nYour children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.\n\nListening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  \nThe very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let\u2019s Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.\nAnd, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.

This Alphabet song in our Let\u2019s Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the vowel a.  \n\nYour children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they\u2019ll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.\nThis letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.\nAll of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.\nYour children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.\n\nListening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  \nThe very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let\u2019s Learn About the Alphabet Series.
