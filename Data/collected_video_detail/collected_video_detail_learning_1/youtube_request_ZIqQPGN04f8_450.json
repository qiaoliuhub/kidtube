And that its most active growth (more than 60% of the volume) and the formation of a neural network of brain synapses occurs at the earliest age during the first 12 months?\nSynaptogenesis is the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system. Although it occurs throughout a healthy person's lifespan, an explosion of synapse formation occurs during early brain development, known as exuberant synaptogenesis (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)\nAnd in order for the brain to develop harmoniously, and the neural network of synapses to grow as much as possible, it needs information, a lot of information, and the more information there is, the better!\nBecause information is food for brain development. Without information, the brain starves and remains underdeveloped.\nDid you know that cognitive abilities, that is, the ability to absorb Knowledge, are at their maximum in newborns, after which they fall in the opposite exponential manner? As we age, it becomes increasingly difficult for us to memorize and assimilate new material, and our cognitive abilities tend to zero. This can be seen in the example of language learning. Babies do not learn languages \u2014 they immediately begin to speak them at the maternal level. How to turn on the bulbs of the Christmas garland, or hang Christmas balls on the Christmas tree\nThis graph shows that when we go to school, we can assimilate Knowledge 3 times worse than newborns.\nAnd many other reasons convince us that it is necessary to start the education of our babies right from birth, from the very first day of life. And our Smart VideoNanny will help us with this. Therefore, our task as caring parents is to create and launch into mass production the Smart VideoNanny.\nNow let's look at exactly how Smart VideoNanny will teach kids.\nToday, the usual VideoNanny can sing to babies only a few songs and lullabies in the manufacturer's language.\nAnd if you complicate the task and make the Smart Video Nanny sing songs and lullabies in 20+ languages? After all, then the children will begin to speak fluently in all these 20+ languages at the mother's level! Of course, lullabies alone will not be enough for a confident command of 20+ languages, but the main idea is already clear.\nAnd if you complicate the task even more and add a couple more channels of information? Overlay nature sounds? And then we will immediately receive a huge amount of information:\n\u2022 Sounds of nature\n\u2022 Sounds of music\n\u2022 Quiet human speech\nDuring the first month of newborns, only one channel \u201cworks\u201d for receiving information \u2014 the auditory channel. Unfortunately, we do not think about it, so most often our kids hear some kind of informational garbage, i.e. frightening and unpleasant sounds from the street, from the TV, from the people around them, and on the basis of all this, their brain is formed.\nI propose to sensibly approach the \u201cloading\u201d of this so important auditory channel and surround the baby in the first month of his life with only the most pleasant, harmonious, and soothing sounds. You just need to combine the murmur of water and the singing of birds with the Far Eastern music \u2014 and overlay the reading of the \"Tao Te Ching\" in the original. And all these programs will be formed according to the choice and preferences of the parents.\nAnd so with all 20+ languages. As you can see, it is not difficult, and Smart VideoNanny can easily cope with this task. Thanks to this, his brain will begin to form much more harmoniously, and the baby himself will be calmer.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aVjKxys7N2w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aVjKxys7N2w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aVjKxys7N2w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aVjKxys7N2w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aVjKxys7N2w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Hermes", "tags": ["The quantum leap in education", "Smart VideoNanny", "Educational Expert online-community", "Online Expert Community", "Education for Newborns", "Newborn`s Explosive Synapsogenesis", "Newborn`s Brain Neural Network`s Explosive Synapsogenesis"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "ru", "localized": {"title": "Smart Video Nanny: A device that will turn the entire education system (machine voice)", "description": "#TheQuantumLeapInEducation #SmartVideoNanny #EducationForNewborns\nPlease donate\nhttps://www.whydonate.eu/fundraising/smartvideonanny-2nd-generation-more-possibilities-more-features\n\nThinking about how to give your child the best education in the world, but you don't have enough money?\nSmart VideoNanny is the answer to all questions!\nSmart VideoNanny is a quantum leap in education!\nSmart VideoNanny will make your child a universal genius with almost no investment of money, time, or effort!\nSo far, this project exists only in my head at the level of an idea.
