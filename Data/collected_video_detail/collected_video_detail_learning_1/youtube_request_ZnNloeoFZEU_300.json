\nof your bones together this is true\nAnd Muscles attach to bone\nwith Tendons connective tissue \nTendons and Ligaments connect \nto bones on either side of a joint\nHolding bones together tightly\nThat is the point\nBone Marrow\u2019s a soft and spongy tissue \nfound inside some bones\nBone Morrow Stroma Stem Cells are called \nMesenchymal \nMesenchymal Stem cells are the two colors \nYellow and Red\nThe yellow color produces fat, bone \nand your cartilage \nThe Red color produces white and \nred blood cells \nIt also makes the Platelets that cause clotting\nto stop bleeding

Femur and it is also \nthe strongest bone you\u2019ll see\nRight below are the Tibia and the Fibula\non you\nThey work together to hold your feet on\nyour body this is true \nLet's not forget that Humerus \nBone on the upper arm\nIt\u2019s attached to the Radius and Ulna\nthat form your forearm \nYour hand is made up of about\n27 bones\nWe\u2019ll focus on those in another one of my \nsongs catchy tones\n\nHello I\u2019m your skeleton \nas you can plainly see\nHere are some of the 206 bones \nin the human body    \n\nLet's move to the Posterior\nor the backside of you\nThe first thing

Vertebrae \nIs made up of 12 bones\nIt\u2019s the longest stretch of your \nthe spinal column that is shown\nThen there's the Lumbar Vertebrae\non your lower back\nIt\u2019s an arch and a very \nimportant bony stack\nOnto your Sacrum, it's attached\nto your Pelvis\nThen the spine ends with the fusion of bones \ncalled the Coccyx \nPlease take care of your bones \nand keep them healthy and strong\nThey give you the structure in your life \nto help you live really long\n\nHello I\u2019m your skeleton \nas you can plainly see\nHere are some of the 206 bones \nin the human body\n\n\nKids
