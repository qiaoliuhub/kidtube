Backyard update Adley & Niko play in the Hot Tub! Snowy Elf is back", "description": "Gingerbread Houses and Spacestation Gaming wins some Rocket League games!\n\nJOIN OUR FAM!! --- http://goo.gl/rfgp8V\n\nBest Morning Swim Day Ever 1172\n\nThe best way to start the morning is with the whole family!! We all gather around Navey to say hello and to start our Chirstmas morning routine of looking for Snowy the Elf on a shelf! She's not playing hide n seek today, because as soon as the kiddos start heading downstairs they see here sitting in on of the windows. Shes surrounded by snowballs? That can mean only one thing...Snowball battle inside our house!! \n\nAfter the snowball fight, we look outside and see he huge flock of birds flying through the sky. Adley, Niko Bear, and I run out to watch them and while we're in the backyard we remember that we haven't shown you the new hot tub cover, it's really cool and way easier for the family. Adley says she wants to go swimming this morning, so suprise morning swim in our backyard hot tub. The kiddos do tricks in the water and surf the waves like the would a beach. Jenny and I give you a mini backyard tour with some updates, and we have tons of family fun swimming around!\n\nAfter the backyard, its time for lunch and cookies while we watch Spacestation Gaming play Rocket League in the RLCS Winter League split. Our guys are doing great. So me and my rocket league buddy/cheerleader/bat head downstairs to watch our boys play. This can also be a great intro for anyone new to SSG or rocket league. While we're watching the game, Jenny and Niko Bear are working on surprise DYI ginger bread trains and barbie dream house. At one point Adley and I almost ruin the surprise when we come upstairs. But Jenny quickly tells us to close our eyes!!\n\nWe head back down to watch the grand championship and Niko learns how to gingerbread. Jenny calls us up and Adley is so shocked to see the barbie house!! She and Niko do a great job at decorating the house and train. All those crafts we've been doing have paid off. The kiddos also turn the vlog into a gingerbread camera, and I wish that was jut pretend play lol \n\n\\\\\\\\\nWatch Adley's last video: Mom Won\u2019t Wakeup!! FAMiLY SLEEPS IN!
