In this video we highlight the various kinds of dinosaurs, talk about how they receive their names, famous dinosaur fossils, and we talk about the people who find dinosaur fossils: Paleontologists. \n\nWe think that one of the most fascinating creatures to ever roam the Earth was the dinosaur. You most likely have heard of dinosaurs, seen pictures of them on TV or the Internet, or may have seen their bones in a museum. Dinosaurs are an interesting group of animals that no longer exist, meaning they are extinct. Dinosaurs evolved, meaning they changed, over millions of years. \n\nIn this dinosaur for kids video we also talk about how the dinosaurs\u2019 extinction took place about 66 million years ago and 75% of all life on Earth died. There are many theories or guesses as to what may have happened leading to the extinction. They include worldwide volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth\u2019s climate, or perhaps a meteorite from space smashing into the Earth. \n\nIf you're looking for more Dinosaur resources check out our FREE comprehensive lesson plan complete with fun activities, worksheets, quizzes and more!
