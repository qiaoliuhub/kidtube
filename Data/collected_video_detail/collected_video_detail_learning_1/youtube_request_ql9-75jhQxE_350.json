Today's finger family is going to come floating by, so look up in the sky as you wait to greet them. The balloon finger family needs to be careful on their way to meet you children. They need to stay away from birds that can pop them. For that they're signing the family finger song, so they can warn the birds from a distance. Once the balloons get here, you babies can tie their strings onto your finger and do the finger play. How about that?
