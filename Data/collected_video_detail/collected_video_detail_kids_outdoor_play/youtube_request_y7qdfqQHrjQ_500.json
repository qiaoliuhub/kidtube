It is the second-largest park in the 23 wards of Tokyo (after Mizumoto Park).[3]\n\nThe 117-metre (384 ft) tall Diamond and Flower Ferris Wheel opened at the park in 2001.[3] On a clear day, it affords views of Tokyo Bay, Chiba, Edogawa, Tokyo Disneyland, and Mount Fuji. It is reportedly the second tallest ferris wheel in Japan.[4]\n\nAbout a third of the park is designated a sea bird sanctuary, which houses a Sea Bird Centre that provides information on the local bird species.[4] The park also has two beaches on artificial islands. The west island is connected to land by the Kasai Nagisa bridge and is a popular place for recreation.[2] The east island is closed to the public as a protected bird habitat and Ramsar site since 2018.[1]\n\nThe park is always crowded during the 'hanami' period of spring, when the Japanese party under cherry trees in bloom."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT6M37S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "105", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "4"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "hkJK0stRnUlq_4xpNbUHurLW7Mc", "id": "WCacC20N-dk", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-03-03T03:22:36Z", "channelId": "UCWTsAPcvCzPjcUP9puccJ6w", "title": "Outdoor Play Ground For Kid's  || Playground for Kids ||", "description": "Playground for Kids | Children's Playing at the Park with Ride.\nThese children's were enjoying with these rides.  \nThe video taken from Comilla, Bangladesh.\n\n\nwww.facebook.com/biloy.mrong\nwww.twitter.com/biloymrongbd\nhttps://biloymrong.blogspot.com/\n\n\u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09af\u09bc\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c3\u09ce\u09b6\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a3 \u0995\u09c7\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0: https://youtu.be/kvOMXnnKUT0\nFunny Videos 2018 / See What Can Do People Without Talking: https://youtu.be/hc6sqPoh23U\n\n\nBangla ta thik ase na: \nhttps://youtu.be/hsCmNiHANew\nHistorical Comilla Moynamoti Shalbon Bihar (\u0995\u09c1\u09ae\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09b2\u09be \u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09ac\u09a8 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09b0 ) :\nhttps://youtu.be/D_avUQ4VbVE\nMegh Balika/ Rofik Shah/ \u09ae\u09c7\u0998 \u09ac\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09be/\u09b0\u09ab\u09bf\u0995 \u09b6\u09be\u09b9 \nhttps://youtu.be/ZV0JDLGNg1Q\n\nMago Ora Bole /\u0995\u09c1\u09ae\u09a1\u09bc\u09cb \u09ab\u09c1\u09b2\u09c7 \u09ab\u09c1\u09b2\u09c7 \u09a8\u09c1\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u09aa\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7\u099b\u09c7 \u09b2\u09a4\u09be\u099f\u09be/Abu Zafar Obaidullah:   https://youtu.be/aLLvQlu-7Ps\n\nFunny Drama 2018/ Banani Major Seminary/Dhaka\nhttps://youtu.be/Oc8Xz-QhSq8\nBorder Guard Bangladesh (BGB) Destroy Drugs & Alcohol\nhttps://youtu.be/5MDOo_gr68s\n\nUS BANGLA AIRLINES || TRAVEL || OUR HONEYMOON || MERMAID BEACH RESORT || BEAUTIFUL BANGLADESH\nhttps://youtu.be/m7gVaFoWZ7g\nMermaid Beach Resort.
