Rain-shine are the supplier of quality children's waterproof clothing throughout the UK.\n\nWe provide all in one waterproofs, all in one snowsuits, waterproof jackets, waterproof trousers and waterproof dungarees for children from age 9 months to 11 years. We also sell childrens swimwear including baby and childrens wetsuits, reusable swim nappies, pool shoes and beach boots.\n\nAt Rain-shine we love to play outdoors.  We believe that being outdoors should be fun and we also believe that having fun doesn't need to cost money or need anything more than some friends and some imagination.  This summer we are trying out some traditional childhood games.\n\nRounders is a British game which dates back to the 1700s!  It's played in two teams, the 'fielders' and the 'batters'.  The batters take turns to hit the ball then run round a wide circle of 'bases'.  The fielders have to catch the ball and reach the base first to knock the batter out of the game.  When all the batters have had a turn, the teams swap over.  Each team collects points for each full circuit of the bases.  \n\nRounders is still played in many Scottish schools.  It's a great way to get kids working together in teams, helps improve hand-eye coordination, and needs concentration and speed to win the game.  Although rounders is normally played in larger teams, our little team of five had great fun with our simplified version our rounders bat is now a firm favourite with the boys!

I am worried that my daughter might fall, though that hasn\u2019t happened yet\u201d.\n\nProduct Description\nUp, down, over, under, through, around - the Little Tikes Hide & Seek Climber is perfect for kids who have mastered mobility and are just learning how to use it. Children are constantly active, and this play set gives them a productive place to learn where all that effort goes. It helps them learn, on a very fundamental level, linguistic concepts like prepositions and scientific ideas like velocity. More importantly, it's fun.

The low height is perfect for their developing balance and gives them a sense of security that will grow into confidence. With an easy rock wall, gentle slide, and connector bridge for climbing over or crawling under, there's a ton of activities to keep your little one occupied for hours. Additional Features: Slide length: 28.25 in. Ground to platform: 18H in. Climbing wall: 12.50H in.
