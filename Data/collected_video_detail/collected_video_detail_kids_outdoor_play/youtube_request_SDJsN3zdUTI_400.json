What a great outdoor room to grow up with? The heavy-duty hooks in the ceiling hold numerous \u2018kids play\u2019 workout equipment and fun-toys strong enough for adults too. Add a turf floor versus concrete so any mishaps or crashes have softer landings. This is the best! The 3 boys in the home love it! Imagine the hours of playtime they will spend here, and they do use it. If they are not having fun in the playroom they scurry down the hillside to the trampoline at the bottom of the yard and spend hours there. Years down the line if not used by the kids as much when they grow into teens, this room can be turned  into a outdoor living space.\n\nThis video will share all kinds of kids retreats \u2013 away from parents and yet in your backyard. Places to play away from the adults \u2013 to come up with fun games and to invent the hide & seek type of activity we all enjoyed at one time ourselves.Playhouses can finish off a landscape design. Trampolines help us get our jump on. Kids need a place hang out on their own!\n\nGibson\u2019s\u2019 Backyard\n\nIn this private retreat, choose the relaxing comfort of an outdoor living area with a perfect view of all activities. A lower deck provides a kids\u2019 social area. However, kids and teens do like to gather around the firepit. Near all the action, this firepit has custom wood seat walls for many guests to enjoy the firelight. It is especially nice to have the sunken spa so close it. Adults like to soak for a while, however, kids might have the tendency to hop in and out, hanging at the fire or goofing off in the in-ground hot tub. They can also run & jump around the playset. Lot\u2019s of fun for all.\n\nDickson\u2019s Family Focused Backyard\n\nThis Backyard Pergola family-focused landscape design draws you in to relax while children have ample areas to play and explore. Access from two patio doors makes toddler playtime easy for mom to orchestrate while taking care of daily inside activities \u2013 the custom fence with latch gates keeping both youth and dogs from straying too far. Later Mom can join in the fun \u2013 perhaps to walk the meandering pathway with unique boardwalk and rope bridge accent or to enjoy the child\u2019s play area.\n\nSome additional landscape design elements include: brick matching hardscape trim on circular patio and steps, brick planters lined with specimen plants, boulder accents, tiered raised garden beds and large open grass areas for child\u2019s play.\n\nMyer\u2019s Backyard\n\nFor kids and young adults, a sunken trampoline gets \u201coohs and ahhs\u201d as young and old give it a try. Oh, the thrill of a trampoline! It\u2019s ageless! Close to the trampoline, a two-level child\u2019s play structure top off the many attractions found in this family-friendly outdoor haven.\n\nWaxman Property\n\nThis roomy outdoor living area hots spots in front of the fire and a dining table to enjoy eating alfresco with a large group of guests. An added white iron bistro set adds an extra bit of charm. You may enjoy the aroma of fresh baked pizza while watching all areas of the landscape. Note the spacious grass area with child\u2019s play structure allows entertainment for the young in clear view of the relaxing adults!\n\nDawson Backyard Campsite\n\nAcross the lush green lawn and down into the woods \u2013 an awesome camp ground sits in a clearing offering unlimited hours of family togetherness. It is hard to match this ultimate in outdoor living . . .\n\nEdelberg Living Space\n\nIt all starts with a desire to transform one\u2019s everyday living space.  Extending that space out your door and into nature, you can double your living space.  By adding features that appeal to all ages you add practical living space that doubles your enjoyment. Kids like to play outside and yet, they love to hang with mom and dad. When you provide space that allows both it brings the family closer.\n\nOutdoor playsets for Kids video shares great photos of play structures, slides, playhouses, tire swings, and kids play in this outdoor living video.
