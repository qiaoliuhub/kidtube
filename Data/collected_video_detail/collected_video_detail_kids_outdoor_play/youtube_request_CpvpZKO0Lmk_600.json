And when those little fun-seekers want a more active kind of fun, the step ladder, 8\u2019 speedy slide, belt swings and swing trapeze bar will have them wondering if the fun will ever end! \nAll-Cedar Construction\nThe Oakmont is made from 100% cedar. With small, tight knot structure, your lumber will be less likely to develop small cracks emanating from knots. \nIn laboratory testing, our durable cedar wood proved to be rot resistant and highly resistant to natural decay. All lumber is pre-stained for a smooth and clear appearance, as well as cut and stamped with the swing set parts number to help speed up the building process.\n\nOur web site\nhttps://kidsplayground.me\nFacebook  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/kidsplaysetsdubai/\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kidsplaysets/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT14S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "3539", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "MiM-W6BtfvQcvTrZzPiehOazKrU", "id": "wPOEm-aOKb4", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-10-26T05:51:34Z", "channelId": "UC6vkuiFfCVFRLu9u8_Au7AQ", "title": "How outdoor play is important for kids", "description": "skit by Masterpiece kids", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPOEm-aOKb4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPOEm-aOKb4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPOEm-aOKb4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPOEm-aOKb4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPOEm-aOKb4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Masterpiece Preschool", "tags": ["11-19-16", "MASTERPIECE PRESCHOOL", "HBR LAYOUT", "NRI LAYOUT", "KALKERE", "KINDERGARDEN", "DAYCARE", "SKIT", "OUTDOOR PLAY", "ANNUAL DAY", "TODDLERS", "KIDS", "PLAY"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How outdoor play is important for kids", "description": "skit by Masterpiece kids"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT8M28S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "43", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/05qjc", "/m/02jjt", "/m/05qjc"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "9b8YuHOLMY6SvUv7884FkzQYRb4", "id": "acYhygbs0Ss", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-06-13T16:15:26Z", "channelId": "UCLyUO6u7joWx5CT3bPXRmrQ", "title": "My Kids outdoor play", "description": "hello friends and family welcome back to our channel...today videos is about the kid's outdoor play with water and other things stay turn and enjoy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acYhygbs0Ss/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acYhygbs0Ss/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acYhygbs0Ss/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acYhygbs0Ss/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "precious and family", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "My Kids outdoor play", "description": "hello friends and family welcome back to our channel...today videos is about the kid's outdoor play with water and other things stay turn and enjoy"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT13M16S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "412", "likeCount": "50", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "52"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "MGiEzTMvynE2fiiiEhmhGFRavc4", "id": "3n8hQ8brJcY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-06-29T00:11:53Z", "channelId": "UC9Cba3MMN6QAHfqenk0ZKUg", "title": "Outdoor  Play Time in ZOO with children Funny video for kids", "description": "Outdoor  Play Time in ZOO with children\nLike and subscribe to my channel!!!

You can perform this set as a warm-up or as a stand-alone practice, any time you feel the need. Perform outdoors and barefoot when possible, or wherever the need for movement arises. In any case, follow these core principles:\r\n\r\nUse your whole body to perform each movement.\r\nBend your knees and get your hips \"talking to your shoulders.\"\r\nBreathe powerfully.\r\nUse your hips, core and torso to power the moves.\r\nExperiment with a variety of stances and challenge yourself with combinations of big and small, fast and slow.\r\nThis sequence is an integral part of the Exuberant Animal Trainer curriculum: all Exuberant Animal Trainers are expected to master the basic sequence.
