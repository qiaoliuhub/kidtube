You can get That YouTub3 Family - The Adventurers Merch here: https://theadventuresguide.com/\n\nHey Adventurers,\nToday we play a classic childhood game called abc freeze tag or alphabet freeze tag. Tag is an active game we use to play on the playground at recess or physical education game. With ABC tag the players can call out a word starting with the first letter of the alphabet and continuing on to the next letter of the alphabet to avoid being tagged by the person who is it. If they can call out a word in time the person who is it must go after a new player. If the person who is it can tag a person before they call out a ABC word then they are frozen until another player can tag them back in. \n\nDisclaimer: This channel is monitored and managed by adults.

Rain-shine are the supplier of quality children's waterproof clothing throughout the UK.\n\nWe provide all in one waterproofs, all in one snowsuits, waterproof jackets, waterproof trousers and waterproof dungarees for children from age 9 months to 11 years. We also sell childrens swimwear including baby and childrens wetsuits, reusable swim nappies, pool shoes and beach boots.\n\nFootball has been played in Scotland since the 1400s.  That's a very, very long time ago!  Today it remains a very popular sport, with local and national teams and thousands of supporters.  People just love football, and many children dream of following in the footsteps of their favourite players. \n\nThe Rain-shine team have been testing some traditional children's games.  This one is for all the football fans - header catch\n\nHeader catch is a great game for practising some basic football skills.  This game requires listening, concentration and good coordination.  It also teaches turn-taking and teamwork. \n\nThe players stand in a circle with the 'captain' at the centre.  The captain throws the ball to each player in turn.  As the ball is thrown, the captain shouts out 'header' or 'catch' and the player has to return the ball in the correct manner before it touches the ground.  If the player fails toe turn the ball, they sit down and the remaining players continue play.  The last player standing is the winner. \n\nOur little team had so much fun, they added their own rules!  In addition to 'header' and 'catch', we also had 'knee' and 'foot'.  I think the kids found it a little harder than they expected, and it took a lot of skill to return the ball.  This game will take a bit of practice, but it was loads of fun trying it out!   Maybe one of our players will be a famous footballer one day? \n\nFor further information on our products just visit http://www.rain-shine.co.uk or email laura@rain-shine.co.uk\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/rainshinewear \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/rainshinewear \nBlog: http://www.rain-shine.co.uk/rainshine...\nLinkedin: http://uk.linkedin.com/in/rainshinewear\n\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/user/rainshine...\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/rainshinewear", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9E3sMORc4n0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9E3sMORc4n0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9E3sMORc4n0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "Rain-shine childrens waterproof clothing", "tags": ["traditional outdoor games", "header catch", "outdoor play"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Header Catch - Traditional Outdoor Games Challenge For Kids - No 3 - Rain-shine", "description": "Kids waterproofs from Rain-shine\n\nhttp://www.rain-shine.co.uk\n\nSIGN UP TO OUR ENEWSLETTER FOR YOUR FREE CHAPTER FROM OUR EBOOK ON MUDDY PLAY - VISIT WWW.RAIN-SHINE.CO.UK\nLet your children have fun outside whatever the weather.

Kids outdoor games and activities to encourage them to explore nature are coming to the new garden and park.  This video shows the early stages of construction. \n\nhttp://OthelloCommunications.com - 678-861-6139 - call us to find out how we can produce your next video.\n\nChildren have a natural curiosity about the world around them. \n\nExperts say children learn by using and stimulating their senses.  And that leads to good brain development. \n\nDid you know up to age 10\u2026we rely on our senses to help us interpret information and build an understanding of the world around us?\n\nBut, some scientists fear that busy schedules and limited access to the outdoors at school or home is causing an increasing number of children to lose touch with nature, which is full of things that stimulate our senses.   \nThere is a solution.  It\u2019s called a discovery garden or children\u2019s garden. \n\nThe popularity of these outdoor activities for kids in a garden setting is growing; here\u2019s why.\n\nDiscovery gardens are a wonderful way to let children get up close and more importantly comfortable in nature.  \n\nOften used as outdoor classrooms, discovery gardens encourage children and adults to enjoy plants, flowers, butterflies and some pretty cool insects. \nDiscovery gardens allow us to use our sense of sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch.
