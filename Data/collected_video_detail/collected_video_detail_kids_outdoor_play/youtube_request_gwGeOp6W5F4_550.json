Tag is an active game we use to play on the playground at recess or physical education game. With ABC tag the players can call out a word starting with the first letter of the alphabet and continuing on to the next letter of the alphabet to avoid being tagged by the person who is it. If they can call out a word in time the person who is it must go after a new player. If the person who is it can tag a person before they call out a ABC word then they are frozen until another player can tag them back in. \n\nDisclaimer: This channel is monitored and managed by adults.
