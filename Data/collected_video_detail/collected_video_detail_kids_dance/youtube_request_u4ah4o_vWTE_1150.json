I got another dance we could try. Just twist with your hips. Ready, cause it goes like this. Twist your hips high, twist your hips low, twist them in the middle and twist them in a row. We're doing the twist. I like it like this. Let's twist right down to the ground. Lower, lower, keep twisting. Now up. That's it, the twist!\nOkay everybody, now I feel like getting funky. Get down and do the Monkey. Fist over fist, just like this. Now we're getting funky. Get down and do the Monkey. Do it fast. It's a blast. Dancing now we're dancing.\nArms out to the side, you've got two wings. It's a dance they call the Fly. What fun it brings, it's a crazy thing. The Fly. My, my, my do the Fly. Oh yeah, flap those wings. We're taking off now, yeah!\nDo the Mashed Potatoes, a dance that can't be beat. You know it is the greatest, mashing with your feet. The Mashed Potatoes, it's the greatest, the latest. The Mashed Potatoes, now mash!  Do the Swim, do the Twist, do the Monkey, do the Fly, Mash Potatoes.
