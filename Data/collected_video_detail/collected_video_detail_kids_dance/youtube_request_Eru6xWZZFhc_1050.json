My name is Matt Steffanina, and I'm going to show you how to dance like Michael Jackson. \n\nNow, Michael Jackson is famous for a lot of different dance moves but we're going to take his biggest move today, and I'm going to break it down for you step by step, and that's the moonwalk. \n\nNow, it's important to note that Michael did not invent the moonwalk, he actually was taught the moonwalk, but he did make it famous. \n\nYou should also know that the moonwalk is a different move and the move that Michael made famous was called the backslide.\n\nThe moonwalk is the same glide, but in a circle, whereas the backslide is done in a straight line, the way Michael did it. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nThe first thing we're going to do is take our back foot, lift the heel up, and press the ball of our foot into the ground. The left foot, or the front foot, is going to slide back across the floor. Now, when you slide your foot, you always want to keep it flat. This goes for almost every glide.\n\nThe illusion is created when it looks like a flat foot is sliding across the ground. For instance, if I bring my heel up and slide my foot on the toe, I lose the illusion. You want to make sure that that heel is in contact with the floor as you're sliding back. \n\nFrom here, you're just going to switch your feet, bringing up the heel of the left foot and pressing down the heel of the right foot. Slide the right foot back. Switch your feet again.\n\nYou're going to repeat this process as many times as you want to get your backslide going across the floor. \n\nA couple things that will help you. Michael was really good at switching his legs really quickly and really strongly. A lot of times when you see people moonwalk, it's very lazy whereas Michael's was very clean and very snappy. So, each time you switch your feet, you want to think of pressing your heel into the floor, and lifting your other heel as quickly as possible. It also helps to get higher up on your toe, so really lift that heel of the supporting foot.\n\nLet's try and do a few of them in a row and start to practice travelling across the floor while doing the backslide. \n\nSo, we want to start up on our right toe, we're going to slide our left foot back, and we're going to connect four slides to glide all the way across the floor. And that's how you dance like Michael Jackson.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eru6xWZZFhc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eru6xWZZFhc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eru6xWZZFhc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eru6xWZZFhc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["dance", "dance hip hop", "dance moves", "dances", "dancing", "hip hop", "hip hop dance", "hip hop dance moves", "hip hop dancers", "hip hop dances", "hip hop dancing", "hip hop moves", "hip hop videos", "hip-hop", "how to dance", "howcast", "michael jackson", "new hip hop"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance like Michael Jackson | Hip-Hop How-to", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBB7763B5596C90A1\n-\n-\nLike these Hip Hop Lessons !!!

Poppy & Posie's fun and educational kids' videos inspire creativity, kindness, and confidence! From telling stories, to singing and dancing, to fun games as well as DIY kids' activities, Poppy & Posie's videos are both entertaining and enriching, touching upon meaningful lessons and topics in a new way,  designed to encourage positive growth and development in their blossoming viewers.

The pressures of royalty have got to Mal so much that the only way she feels she can be happy is to ditch heart-throb BF Ben and go back to being rotten on the Isle of the Lost. However, things have changed A LOT on the Isle the worst being that her arch nemesis Uma (daughter of Ursula \ud83d\udc19) has taken over her turf! Let\u2019s just say Uma has not forgotten all the wicked things Mal did before she left for Auradon and with the help of the Harry (Captain Hook\u2019s son ) and Gil (Gaston\u2019s son) she is plotting payback! \n\nThis action-packed tale is not without more brand-new songs from the VK\u2019s like \u2018Ways to be Wicked\u2019, \u2018What\u2019s My Name\u2019 and \u2018Chillin\u2019 like a Villain\u2019. Not to mention their awesome covers of \u2018Kiss the Girl\u2019 and \u2018Poor unfortunate Souls\u2019 from Disney\u2019s classic \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019. \n\nWho\u2019s who? \n\nMal (Dove Cameron) is the daughter of Maleficent, but this villain kid has traded in her wicked ways on the Isle of the Lost to become King Ben\u2019s GF and Auradon\u2019s most popular \u2018Lady of the Court\u2019. However, Ben\u2019s magic ban has made living in the kingdom hard and Mal can\u2019t help but use her little book of spells for even the simplest of things. \n\nEvie (Sofia Carson) may be the daughter of the Evil Queen however, she is nothing like her. Her kind and smart nature, paired with a wicked fashion sense means she is not your typical villain kid. Evie has dreamed of living in Auradon her whole life, but the idea of doing it without her bestie, Mal is not an option and they sing it out in their awesome duet \u2018Rather Be with You\u2019. The pair are absolute bestfriend goals!\n\nCarlos (Cameron Boyce) is the tech whiz-kid of the crew and his new life in Auradon has meant he is free of the grasps of his evil mother Cruella de Vil. Not only this, but thanks to King Ben he has outgrown his fear of dogs created by Cruella and now couldn\u2019t live without his canine side-kick Dude! \n\nJay (Booboo Stewart) is also back to join his VK pals! Jafar\u2019s son has well and truly left his thieving ways back on the Isle and now saves his impressive skills for Auradon High\u2019s sports teams only. Jay is actually so awesome that he was crowned captain of the Auradon Swords and Shields Team\u2026 haha, beat that Chad Charming! \n\nUma (China Anne McClain) is the daughter of Ursula, new queen of the run-down town and not to mention Mal\u2019s life-long archenemy! Uma certainly isn\u2019t one to let things go, she is still bitter that she wasn\u2019t chosen by King Ben to live in Auradon and is on a mission of revenge! She\u2019s pretty fierce and you certainly won\u2019t forget her name after the film is over. Whats my name? UMA! \n\nKing Ben (Mitchell Hope) As Ben becomes the King of Auradon he tries to change the kingdom for the better. His first royal decree is to reverse his parents\u2019 (Queen Belle and King Adam) law of keeping all children of the Isle on there, he believes they should get a chance of redemption. Much like his mother did with the Beast, Ben sees behind Mal\u2019s rottenness and they fall in love *Aww* \u2764. \n\nHarry (Thomas Doherty form The Lodge) is Uma\u2019s first mate in the pirate gang, pretty fitting seeing as he is Captain Hook\u2019s son!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3bFj4vXAuY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3bFj4vXAuY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3bFj4vXAuY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3bFj4vXAuY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a3bFj4vXAuY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "DisneyChannelUK", "tags": ["walt", "disney", "uk", "disney channels", "disney channels uk", "disney channel", "lennahc yensid", "disney channel uk", "dc", "tv", "television", "HD", "kid", "kids", "girl", "girls", "children", "boy", "boys", "descendants", "descendants 2", "wicked world", "2 stnatnecsed", "stnatnecsed", "mal", "dove cameron", "evie", "sofia carson", "carlos", "cameron boyce", "jay", "booboo stewart", "Thomas Doherty", "Harry Hook", "China Anne Mcclain", "Uma", "Dylan Playfair", "Gil", "Chillin like a Villian", "Dance tutorial", "dance a-long", "how to", "step-by-step"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Descendants 2 | Chillin' like a Villain: Dance Tutorial | Official Disney Channel UK", "description": "Check out the awesome Sofia Carson, who plays Evie in Descendants, in this behind the scenes, easy to follow, dance tutorial for the new Descendants 2 song Chillin' like a Villain!\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfb6 \n\nLet us know how you get on in the comments below \u2b07\ufe0f and for more Descendants 2 \ud83c\udf4e content head over to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Geemcr_cx6k&list=PLARVidk9CuvHTI3YQQlUtGNoPgyzF3Kdm \n\nWatch Descendants 2 on Disney Channel UK!\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Check out the Disney Channel App for more awesome content!\ud83d\udcf1\nAndroid user?

Jay is actually so awesome that he was crowned captain of the Auradon Swords and Shields Team\u2026 haha, beat that Chad Charming! \n\nUma (China Anne McClain) is the daughter of Ursula, new queen of the run-down town and not to mention Mal\u2019s life-long archenemy! Uma certainly isn\u2019t one to let things go, she is still bitter that she wasn\u2019t chosen by King Ben to live in Auradon and is on a mission of revenge! She\u2019s pretty fierce and you certainly won\u2019t forget her name after the film is over. Whats my name? UMA! \n\nKing Ben (Mitchell Hope) As Ben becomes the King of Auradon he tries to change the kingdom for the better. His first royal decree is to reverse his parents\u2019 (Queen Belle and King Adam) law of keeping all children of the Isle on there, he believes they should get a chance of redemption. Much like his mother did with the Beast, Ben sees behind Mal\u2019s rottenness and they fall in love *Aww* \u2764. \n\nHarry (Thomas Doherty form The Lodge) is Uma\u2019s first mate in the pirate gang, pretty fitting seeing as he is Captain Hook\u2019s son!"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M47S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "6294002", "likeCount": "50249", "dislikeCount": "1069", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "6"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/064t9", "/m/02lkt", "/m/04rlf", "/m/064t9", "/m/02lkt"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "7mUGjVv5muutMmtOnBadLZqwh78", "id": "jHWoVDQkGH4", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-06-10T19:00:52Z", "channelId": "UCMdsYOaE-TN9bIf1_f_5Ecg", "title": "Savage Love Dance Tutorial | Jason Derulo Savage Love Tik Tok Tutorial", "description": "Yo its ya boy Lord Hec with a Savage Love Dance Tutorial by Jason Derulo thats been going viral on Tiktok and I figured it be a great idea that I do my own Jason Derulo Savage Love Tik Tok Tutorial for you guys to follow and Learn !

I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. The five basic positions of ballet are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th. \r\nSo first position is when your toes are apart and your heels are squeezed directly together. A lot of people try to turn out the toes too much, and this creates stress in the knees, so follow your natural turnout line, and stand fully supported, very tall, making sure you're not rolling onto the inside of your foot, or rolling to the outside. Make sure that your feet and your weight are directly over and centered onto your toes. And then your arms are going to be like a round beach ball, and you should have your arms directly in front of your belly button not too high and not too low so directly in front of your belly button, your chest is open and your shoulders are down and you are engaging your back, and you stand in first position. \r\n\r\nSecond position, your arms and legs are out to the side, and you actually want to gauge the length of your second position by putting one toe next to your heel, then opening it up, and then extending it a little further. you shouldn't have too wide a second position, or too narrow, because you wont be fully supported when you're moving around in that position. Second position arms are rounded and slightly forward, you dont want to throw your arms too far back, so keep them nice, round, and forward, and that's second position.\r\n\r\nThird position is used on a very basic level. It is when you are practicing to get to fifth position. You want to put your heel in the centre of your foot, and stand with both feet firmly on the ground, feet turned out. Your arms are going to come one high above your head and one directly to the side. Make sure that both arms are rounded and that your chest is lifted and your neck is long.\r\n \r\nFourth position, your leg comes out, and your heel is going to try to become in front of that toe, and your arm is going to be coming in front of your belly button. We want to make sure that your fourth position is not too wide, just like second position, and not too narrow. You want to have a pretty narrow fourth position, which will help you when you do turns in the centre.\r\nFifth position, both arms are up very high, and your chest is open, shoulders down, and your feet and heels are going to be connected. You don't want to try to squeeze your turnout and make both feet and heels connected fully, you want to follow the natural line of your turnout, and make sure that when you pliet, your knees are going directly over your toes. \r\n\r\nSo standing in fifth position, your arms are going to go all the way up, like this, and thats high fifth, and then low fifth, your arms are down here.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3bawTEPLtA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3bawTEPLtA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3bawTEPLtA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3bawTEPLtA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "HowcastArtsRec", "tags": ["adult ballet", "adult ballet class", "adult ballet lessons", "ballerina", "ballet", "ballet class", "ballet classes", "ballet dance", "ballet dancer", "ballet dancers", "ballet dancing", "ballet moves", "ballet online", "ballet positions", "ballet school", "ballet workout"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Do the 5 Basic Positions | Ballet Dance", "description": "Watch more Ballet Dancing Lessons videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/497197-How-to-Do-the-5-Basic-Positions-Ballet-Dance\n\n\n\nMy name is Maegan Woodin, and I'm  a professional dancer, choreographer, teacher and student.
