If you're the man, hold the woman along her back with your right arm. If you're the woman, rest your left arm along the man's back, pressing your extended hands together.\n\nStep 2: Step and hop\nStep to your left, if you're the man. If you're the woman, step to your right. Each person hops the second step with their opposite foot, the other just coming off the floor. Then bring your feet down next to each other.\n\nStep 3: Reverse step\nDraw your partner back with you as you reverse the step with a right, and then a right side hop, setting the left foot down. \n\nTip\nTake lessons or buy some CDs to get the rhythm down before trying.\n\nStep 4: Spin and hop\nTurn out slightly by hopping out on your left if you're the man, and spinning yourself 180 degrees.

If you're the man, hold the woman along her back with your right arm. If you're the woman, rest your left arm along the man's back, pressing your extended hands together.\n\nStep 2: Step and hop\nStep to your left, if you're the man. If you're the woman, step to your right. Each person hops the second step with their opposite foot, the other just coming off the floor. Then bring your feet down next to each other.\n\nStep 3: Reverse step\nDraw your partner back with you as you reverse the step with a right, and then a right side hop, setting the left foot down. \n\nTip\nTake lessons or buy some CDs to get the rhythm down before trying.\n\nStep 4: Spin and hop\nTurn out slightly by hopping out on your left if you're the man, and spinning yourself 180 degrees. The woman follows, hopping instead on her right.\n\nStep 5: Swing her\nSwing the woman around with you as you hop back now with the right, finishing a circle and bringing her around to starting position as you set both feet down, side by side again. \n\nStep 6: Start again\nStart the steps all over again as you wheel around the floor, hopping on the first notes of each phrase.

It's a grapevine. I think we've all done the grapevine at some point in our lives. Whether we're at a birthday party, a wedding, wherever you are. A backyard barbecue, yeah, it's popular there. It's very, very simple. And it's just a side to side motion for you to either cool down to or warm up to.  Okay? This is one of those easy recovery steps to add into your workout between something that might be a little more challenging. Okay?\n\nSo I want you to start over to the left. You're going to move to the right first. It's three steps, three easy steps. Side, back, side, tap. Side, back, side. Don't cross in front. Side, behind, side, tap. Side, behind, side. Okay? Super basic. Keep this nice and relaxed. Keep this easy up top. One, two, three, tap.\n\nNow, you have it. Take it up to tempo. Not too much faster, but just to get the flow of the grapevine. Okay? Here we go. One, two, three, tap. Two, three. You can do whatever you want with your arms. Right? Don't just stay here like this. Add a little funk to it. One, two, three, tap. Two, three, tap. One, two. Make sure you're crossing behind. One, two, three. One, two, you can even add a little snake of the head. Yeah? I know you've done that before. One, two, tap. One, two, tap. Last one. And hold. Okay?\n\nSo, once again, this is a great warmup step or a good cool down step, not something super serious. It's just to relax, to keep your heart rate going, and to keep you moving.

It's a grapevine. I think we've all done the grapevine at some point in our lives. Whether we're at a birthday party, a wedding, wherever you are. A backyard barbecue, yeah, it's popular there. It's very, very simple. And it's just a side to side motion for you to either cool down to or warm up to.  Okay? This is one of those easy recovery steps to add into your workout between something that might be a little more challenging. Okay?\n\nSo I want you to start over to the left. You're going to move to the right first. It's three steps, three easy steps. Side, back, side, tap. Side, back, side. Don't cross in front. Side, behind, side, tap. Side, behind, side. Okay? Super basic. Keep this nice and relaxed. Keep this easy up top. One, two, three, tap.\n\nNow, you have it. Take it up to tempo. Not too much faster, but just to get the flow of the grapevine. Okay? Here we go. One, two, three, tap. Two, three. You can do whatever you want with your arms. Right? Don't just stay here like this. Add a little funk to it. One, two, three, tap. Two, three, tap. One, two. Make sure you're crossing behind. One, two, three. One, two, you can even add a little snake of the head. Yeah? I know you've done that before. One, two, tap. One, two, tap. Last one. And hold. Okay?\n\nSo, once again, this is a great warmup step or a good cool down step, not something super serious. It's just to relax, to keep your heart rate going, and to keep you moving. Okay?\n\nHave fun."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M11S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "192979", "likeCount": "553", "dislikeCount": "77", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "38"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/027x7n", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/027x7n", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "syTix7ho9gbKcfR63wD_myxHuDc", "id": "uczTGOjAtLo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2013-08-16T19:23:12Z", "channelId": "UCSpVHeDGr9UbREhRca0qwsA", "title": "How to Dance to House Music | Sexy Dance Moves", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhBM3T68vyiGknKGPbOOXki\n-\n-\nLike these Dance Lessons !!!

And with house, you just want to understand that there is a groove with it, and it's a bounce. Okay? And this bounce is like up and down. Up, yeah?\n\nLaShonna:  Yeah.\n\nVictor:  And then with this bounce, you can do simple movements with your feet, that will, you know, be house steps. So basically we have the cross. Step, step, cross, step, step. So you're going to cross with your right leg over, and place over your left. Then step back with your right, to cross over with your left, to place over your right and then step back with your left. And then you want to go one, two, and three, four, and five, six, and seven, eight, and one. Okay? But now the challenge here is to do it with the bounce. Cool? So you want to go one, two, and three, four, and five, six, and seven, eight, and one. \n\nAnd then we have two more dances.\n\nLaShonna:  Alright. This second step that we're going to learn is just a little heel step together. So you're going to keep that same bounce, which is called the jinga. That same jinga, jinga, jinga. You have heel together, heel together, heel together, heel together. Without that little groove, it just looks like this. So you want to add that house groove, that up down motion. Up down, up down. Like you're riding a horse. Awesome. We have one more step that we're going to incorporate into our house dance.\n\nVictor:  This next step is simple. You're going to hop on your left leg, and lift up your right leg, and lift up your left arm. And then you place your right leg down. Hop on your right leg. Lift your left leg up. Place that down. And then you're going to do it twice, hopping on your left leg, and placing your right leg in between each hop. So you hop, boom, boom, and we're going to repeat that. So you're going to go single, single, double, double. Single, single, double, double. Alright? And you still want to keep that same like jinga, as LaShonna said. Yeah? That same up and down movement, and you want to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\nLaShonna:  Let's put all three moves together.\n\nVictor:  Yeah.\n\nLaShonna:  And then we'll be doing some house dancing. Ready? Let's start with the step that Victor showed us. We're going to go one, two, three. Then the heel step that I showed you. One, two, three, four. Now the hop step that Victor showed you. Single, single, double. Single, single, double. Awesome.\n\nAnd that's how you dance to house music.\n\nVictor:  There it is.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uczTGOjAtLo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uczTGOjAtLo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uczTGOjAtLo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uczTGOjAtLo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uczTGOjAtLo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["house music", "Howcast", "dance", "dance moves", "dance move", "dancing", "how to dance", "dance video", "dance videos", "dance lessons"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance to House Music | Sexy Dance Moves", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhBM3T68vyiGknKGPbOOXki\n-\n-\nLike these Dance Lessons !!!

Hey guys, it's Girls With Heart Ambassador, Emma. And today I'm going to be teaching you a dance tutorial from The Nutcracker. And it's a little part from the Sugar Plum Fairy. So, let's get started. Okay so, the first step goes tendu, beat beat, which is in in, and then goes out. And you do it on relev\u00e9 with your arms out straight and bent. So this is down, up up, down. Then it goes swivel into a back tendu. Then it goes pas de bourr\u00e9e, which is back, side, front. Then you cut in front, and then you back coup\u00e9. Then you go in-out again, in-out, and then comes the pas de cheval, which goes down and then just presents. So it goes... And then pas de boure\u00e9. And this next part is a little challenging, but I think all of you can do it if you just work on it, and yeah. So then you go here, and it's a back attitude, which is back tendu and you just lift it up and bend it. So then you go here, and then you do it again, and it moves this way. Then you step back and tendu! So now we put it all together, and this is what it looks like! 5, 6, 7, 8 5, 6, 7, 8 I hope you guys enjoyed learning this dance tutorial from The Nutcracker.
