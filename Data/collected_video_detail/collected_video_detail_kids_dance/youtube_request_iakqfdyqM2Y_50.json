And no matter where you're learning a dance for cheerleading, knowing how to learn a dance is very important. Step one. Start off by learning the first four counts of the dance. And once you have those, you can move on and learn the next four. Remember to count out loud.\n\nAlright. So we're going to start this one off to the side and we're going to hold. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. We're going to hit a high beat on one. We're going to swing it around on two. Punch it three. We're going to clean to the side on four. Do you have that much? Okay. From here, we're just going to hit five. Bring it down to our knee on six. Pull it back up on seven. And then back down on eight.\n\nStep two. Now that you know the first eight count of the dance, start from the beginning, go through the entire first eight count, and then add on four more counts. So moving on from here we're going to clean on one. We're going to punch it up on two. We're going to punch it across on three. And then we're going to bring it up on four. Continue doing this pattern of starting from the beginning, adding on four more counts, until you get to the very end.\n\nStep three is to do the dance full out to counts. Now that you know all of the moves for all of the counts, you can start from the beginning, and count out loud, until you make it from the beginning to the end, several times. Alright. Let's do this one all the way through. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.\n\nStep four is dance to the music. Listen to the track a couple of times, and know exactly when the first count of the dance starts.

I'm Ava. This is my sister Loretta and this is Anthony. Right now we're going to show you some three basic moves on how to dance to hip-hop music. The main thing with hip-hop I guess is just be, like, relaxed and, like, have fun. Not too serious. Like you don't want to stand up too straight because you'll be, like, stiff, you know. You're going to stand basically, like, shoulder width apart with your feet and your knees are going to bent a little bit. This is pretty much where you live and where you start with all of your hip-hop grooves. \n\nThe first hip-hop groove Loretta is going to take us through.\n\nLoretta:  We can do just a basic kick-ball-change. You're going to take one foot, you're just going kick in front. Then you're going to cross it over. Then the back foot is going to step back. Then you're going to do the same thing. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. When you double time it, here we go. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. \n\nYou could also add a little bounce to it, to the beat. That's the relaxed, chill mood of hip-hop. Let's do it again. Five, six, seven, eight. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. Awesome. Next move.\n\nAnthony:  Sweet. Now we're going to break into the slide and step. We're going to slide and hit, slide and hit. And hit. Now if you want to get some more energy it's going to be a hop, and hop, and hop, and hop. Now let's put that together. To the right. Five, six, seven, eight. Slide and hop, and hop, and hop. Awesome\n\nAva:  I'm feeling hip-hoppy already. OK, so one more move we're going to show you is just basically you're going to stand shoulder width apart and your hands are going to come out and then come in and then come out and then come in. While you do that your hips are going to move with it. They're going to go out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in. Right? We're going to start together and then we're going to jump out as we do this and add a little bit of bounce to it. Five, six, seven, eight. Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in.

I'm Ava. This is my sister Loretta and this is Anthony. Right now we're going to show you some three basic moves on how to dance to hip-hop music. The main thing with hip-hop I guess is just be, like, relaxed and, like, have fun. Not too serious. Like you don't want to stand up too straight because you'll be, like, stiff, you know. You're going to stand basically, like, shoulder width apart with your feet and your knees are going to bent a little bit. This is pretty much where you live and where you start with all of your hip-hop grooves. \n\nThe first hip-hop groove Loretta is going to take us through.\n\nLoretta:  We can do just a basic kick-ball-change. You're going to take one foot, you're just going kick in front. Then you're going to cross it over. Then the back foot is going to step back. Then you're going to do the same thing. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. When you double time it, here we go. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. \n\nYou could also add a little bounce to it, to the beat. That's the relaxed, chill mood of hip-hop. Let's do it again. Five, six, seven, eight. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. Awesome. Next move.\n\nAnthony:  Sweet. Now we're going to break into the slide and step. We're going to slide and hit, slide and hit. And hit. Now if you want to get some more energy it's going to be a hop, and hop, and hop, and hop. Now let's put that together. To the right. Five, six, seven, eight. Slide and hop, and hop, and hop. Awesome\n\nAva:  I'm feeling hip-hoppy already. OK, so one more move we're going to show you is just basically you're going to stand shoulder width apart and your hands are going to come out and then come in and then come out and then come in. While you do that your hips are going to move with it. They're going to go out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in. Right? We're going to start together and then we're going to jump out as we do this and add a little bit of bounce to it. Five, six, seven, eight. Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in. Awesome.\n\nLoretta:  Those are three basic steps that you can do to dance to hip-hop music. Go through them one more time. First one, kick-ball-change. Five, six, seven, eight. Kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change. \n\nAnthony:  Now we have the slide hop. Five, six, seven, eight. Slide, slide, slide, slide.\n\nAva:  Awesome.

My name is Loretta. This is my sister, Ava. We're the Double Time Twins.  And today we're going to teach you to dance by yourself. So the two main things to remember when you're dancing by yourself is to just have confidence and have fun doing  whatever it is you're doing.  The cool thing about dancing by yourself is that you don't have to do somebody else's rhythm. You don't have to work.\n\nAva:  So if Loretta's in a slow kind of groove, but you don't feel like doing that groove, that's totally fine because you're dancing by yourself.  So whatever groove you want to do, you can do. Okay, so Loretta's going to demonstrate how you can dance by yourself on the dance floor. So, since you have the entire dance floor by yourself, you're not going to stay in one box, right?  \n\nLoretta:  Right.\n\nAva:  So, Loretta's going to show you how to dance in a box. No, a little box. Like if you didn't have the whole dance floor, you would just stand in a box like this, because there's other people around you, right? But you have the whole dance floor to yourself because you're dancing by yourself. So, you're going to use it.  So, dance in a big box, like you have the whole dance floor, right?\n\nLoretta:  Alright.\n\nAva:  Okay, so we go, step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  So, we can go to the side first.  Side, together. Then you can take it back. Back, together. Take it to the other side. Side, together. Then take it back up front. Stop, Front, together. Awesome, let's do that again. Five, six, seven, eight.  Step, together, take it back. Take it side. Take it front. Awesome. Alright, so, let's do that faster as if we have the whole dance floor together.\n\nLoretta:  Well, you want to do that because I'm dancing by myself?\n\nAva:  Right, Loretta can do it because she's dancing by herself. Five, six, seven, eight.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  One, two, three, you can turn while you're doing it, too. Awesome, six, seven, eight.

Then you reverse it. Toes in, one toe up, then the heel on the other leg. Then you keep going. Up, down, and up. It's a little bit trickier than it looks, but it's a lot of fun to do once you get going and then you work it out a little bit faster. Good.

So, we're going to go jump, jump, jump and rock, jump, jump, jump and rock. A little bit slower.

My name's Loretta. This is my twin sister, Ava. This is Anthony. Today, we're going to teach you how to dance to rock music. So the basic thing that you want to do when you're listening to rock, if you're at a concert, if you're at a club or anything, is basically, just to feel the beat in your attitude, right?  So when you're in it, what do we all do when we hear rock music?  \n\nAnthony:  Raise our arms.\n\nLoretta:  Our arm is up and that's what you do. As cliche as it might possibly be, that's what feels good and that's just kind of like how your body goes. So one arm is up and your head goes with it and your arm pulses front; one two, three, four; add a bounce; five, six, seven, eight.\n\nAnthony:  And another thing you guys want to keep in mind, is that you don't want to just wave your arms around like you don't care. But if you stay on beat and really feel the pulse, people around you are going to pick up on that, and you're going to look like a cool guy or girl.\n\nLoretta:  And you're going to be rocking out. It's going to be awesome. Another move that we could do is the air guitar.\n\nAva:  The air guitar.\n\nAnthony:  The air guitar, so our air guitar is a simple two-step, which is rock and hit, rock and hit, rock and hit, rock and hit.  Now you can bring it low, if you want. We can rock and hit low, rock and hit low, rock and hit low, rock and hit low. Or you can bring it up and you can slap the face and put it over your head even, and we're rocking it high, rocking it high, rocking it high, rocking it high.\n\nLoretta:  Awesome, so those are two simple dance moves that you can do to rock the music, to rock out with your friends.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWkUc3fMMq0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWkUc3fMMq0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWkUc3fMMq0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWkUc3fMMq0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWkUc3fMMq0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["howcast", "dance", "dancing", "dance video", "how to dance", "dance moves", "dance tutorial", "dance videos", "dance step", "rock music"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance to Rock Music | Beginner Dancing", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhxI-A93uUIOuv57jJ8fCm6\n-\n-\nLearning to Dance?

I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. A pirouette in Ballet is a turn that is very commonly found on the basic to intermediate level. The amount of turns depends on the skill of the dancer. So you can start off by just doing a passe in Releve to doing a half turn, to doing a full turn, to doing two, three, four. And for male dancers they can do up to ten pirouettes at a time. So it is important to think about the alignment and the position of your fourth position, which most pirouette's start in. So if you stand in fourth position, again your fourth position shouldn't be too wide, it should be pretty small and your weight should be evenly between both legs. Your arms are going to open up, one arm is to the side one arm is in front. You are going to start in a plie position. When you plie you are going to open up both arms, that is going to be the start of your plie and the start of your pirouette. You are going to open up your arms then bring them together and your foot is going to come passe. So again you are going to plie, open up your arm and everything is going to zip up into passe. And that is the very basic level. And you turn it when you become more advanced.

I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. A pirouette in Ballet is a turn that is very commonly found on the basic to intermediate level. The amount of turns depends on the skill of the dancer. So you can start off by just doing a passe in Releve to doing a half turn, to doing a full turn, to doing two, three, four. And for male dancers they can do up to ten pirouettes at a time. So it is important to think about the alignment and the position of your fourth position, which most pirouette's start in. So if you stand in fourth position, again your fourth position shouldn't be too wide, it should be pretty small and your weight should be evenly between both legs. Your arms are going to open up, one arm is to the side one arm is in front. You are going to start in a plie position. When you plie you are going to open up both arms, that is going to be the start of your plie and the start of your pirouette. You are going to open up your arms then bring them together and your foot is going to come passe. So again you are going to plie, open up your arm and everything is going to zip up into passe. And that is the very basic level. And you turn it when you become more advanced.
