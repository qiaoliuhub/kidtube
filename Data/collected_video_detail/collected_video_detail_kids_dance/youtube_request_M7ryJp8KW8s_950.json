However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right-hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).\n\nIf you like this movie and our channel, please subscribe: https://goo.gl/MiTYgs"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H21M56S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "regionRestriction": {"blocked": ["FR", "GB"]}, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "21802", "likeCount": "229", "dislikeCount": "16", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "42"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn", "/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "RWedV0wIT7quJfObkHq-zkbusi8", "id": "SbPio7lzskg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-09-20T01:00:00Z", "channelId": "UCk5bIh544LgQ2_ecTQQ5wQg", "title": "THE BUTTERFLY | Great Book of Nature | Full Episode 15 | English", "description": "In the first part of the episode, a swan asks a bear to help recover a stone flower that has fallen into a fountain in so blocking the drain.

In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.\nPetersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.\nStrangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).\nOne night, Toomai's father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai's father is killed. Kala Nag's grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.\nPetersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job. When Rham Lahl beats the elephant, however, Kala Nag injures his tormenter. The mahout insists that Kala Nag be destroyed, as is the law.

In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.\nPetersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.\nStrangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).\nOne night, Toomai's father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai's father is killed. Kala Nag's grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.\nPetersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job.

Great for toddlers, preschool and kindergarten children as well as the ESL and EFL classroom. \n\nAll of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.\n\nOur unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you\u2019re sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.\n\nDon't forget to visit the resource library on our website for printable flashcards, crafts, worksheets, activities, games and more.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysWLALtSlHc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysWLALtSlHc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysWLALtSlHc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysWLALtSlHc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysWLALtSlHc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Maple Leaf Learning", "tags": ["parachute dance", "parachute song", "parachute dance song", "parachute song for kids", "parachute song for preschool", "parachute song for babies", "parachute dance for children", "simple songs for kids", "songs for kids", "songs for preschool", "songs for kindergarten", "songs with actions for kids", "songs with actions for toddlers", "easy songs", "simple songs", "parachute", "dance", "song", "songs", "maple leaf learning playhouse", "maple leaf learning club", "marty moose", "maple leaf learning", "maple leaf"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Parachute Dance Song | Maple Leaf Learning", "description": "Let's do the Parachute Dance!

Great for toddlers, preschool and kindergarten children as well as the ESL and EFL classroom. \n\nAll of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.\n\nOur unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun.
