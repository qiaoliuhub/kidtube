Last year\u2019s BeatBo was a toy robot that played music and danced, encouraging babies and toddlers to dance along with him. Now BeatBo is back but with an interactive dance mat for even more dancing and learning fun. \n\nThe centerpiece of the soft Learning Lights Dance Mat is the BeatBo character in the center of the mat. This BeatBo has motion sensors on its front and back to know where babies are moving as they dance around the mat. When BeatBo senses a child\u2019s motion, it will play music, phrases, and a light show. Babies can also press any of the four buttons on BeatBo\u2019s base for more lights, songs, and phrases. Unlike the original BeatBo, the BeatBo on this dance mat doesn\u2019t dance and move, but babies can bat at BeatBo to make him spin around.\n\nThere are two modes of play with the Dance Mat. In Move & Play mode, there are music, phrases, and lights to encourage baby to get moving and introduce them to colors. For instance, when babies press any of the four buttons on the base, they\u2019ll hear BeatBo say the color of the button, ask kids to find a color, or hear fun dance-along songs. And in Dance & Learn mode, babies will hear songs and play games about ABCs, numbers one through 10, shapes, and colors.\n\nFollow Us on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TTPMOfficial \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ttpm \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/ttpmofficial/ \n\nDisclosure: Toys reviewed by TTPM are selected by the TTPM editorial team from submissions from manufacturers who provide the samples for review consideration.
