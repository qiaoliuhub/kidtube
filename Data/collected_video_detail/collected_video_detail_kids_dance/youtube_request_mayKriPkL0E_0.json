What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance to house music. The basic thing when we're dancing to house is really just be in the moment, and love it and just be in it, and just really be free. \n\nAnthony:  So house music has a bunch of different varieties. You have the different beats, you have the different sounds, and you have the different rhythms. But if you keep on the rhythm and keep the bounce in your feet and always be free and let it come to you, you'll be fine dancing to house music.\n\nNow the step I'm going to teach you guys today is the cross hit. We're going to do it slow. We're going to jump and hit, and we're going to cross our feet. Left foot coming forward, right foot going back to start. Ready? Cross and hit, now you're going to switch feet. You're right foot is going to come forward and you're left is going to go back. Ready? Cross hit, and we're going to do that four times, really slow. \n\nReady? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit. Now if you want to speed it up, you can. If you want to stay at this pace, you're more than welcome to. So we're going to stay at this pace, and just do it eight times really quick, so you guys can see the basics. \n\nRight foot is going to go behind first, left foot is going to go forward and we're going to cross and hit. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, and cross hit. So since we just taught you the steps about the cross hit, I'm going to teach you about the arms. \n\nIt's the same kind of thing. When we cross, right foot going back, left going forward, we're going to cross our arms and then open them out. Cross them again and open them out. So this when you pair them together, gives you more of like a rhythm and a feel, and it really gets you loose,  instead of just doing this the whole time. You kind of almost look like an Irish dancer. But if you have some flow into it and you're really able to pop, you'll be able to make it a lot more efficient, and a lot more people looking at you.\n\nLoretta:  Absolutely.\n \nAnthony:  So we're going to do this four times; five six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; and  that's how you dance to house music.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["howcast", "dance", "dancing", "dance video", "how to dance", "dance moves", "dance tutorial", "dance videos", "dance step", "house music"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance to House Music | Beginner Dancing", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhxI-A93uUIOuv57jJ8fCm6\n-\n-\nLearning to Dance?

My name's Loretta and this is Ava.  We're the Double Time Twins and today we're going to teach you how to dance when you're at the club and the deejay is mixing.  Usually there's maybe five, maybe ten seconds depending on where you are when the deejay is scratching, when you're not really sure what kind of songs are going to come on next.\n\nAva:  And if you're with your friends in a group, it could be an awkward five or ten seconds.  Everyone's standing in a circle like . . .\n\nBoth:  . . . \"cool, wonder what they're going to play next.  I wonder what's going on.  What's going on?  I don't know, I don't know.\"  \n\nAva:  And then the song kicks in and you're like, \"oh my God, that's my song.\"  \n\nLoretta:  So, basically, two things to remember is to just keep moving, keep dancing and while that awkward five or ten seconds is going on, you can never go wrong with a step-touch.  So that's what we're going to show you how to do today.  So, basically, start out with your feet shoulder width apart.  And take your right foot and go step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  And that's it.  That's what you could do when the deejay stops.\n\nAva:  You can even add a snap if you want, or a head, snake it out, go down and up.\n\nLoretta:  You can pretty much do whatever you want with this move. You can put your arms up, bring them down, anything you want.  Just remember two things during that five or ten seconds while the deejay is mixing, keep moving, keep dancing, keep the party going.  And that's how you dance when the deejay is mixing.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALQgZB-c5nY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALQgZB-c5nY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALQgZB-c5nY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALQgZB-c5nY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALQgZB-c5nY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["howcast", "dance", "dancing", "dance video", "how to dance", "dance moves", "dance tutorial", "dance videos", "dance steps", "dance step"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance When the DJ is Mixing | Beginner Dancing", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhxI-A93uUIOuv57jJ8fCm6\n-\n-\nLearning to Dance?

I don't know, I don't know.\"  \n\nAva:  And then the song kicks in and you're like, \"oh my God, that's my song.\"  \n\nLoretta:  So, basically, two things to remember is to just keep moving, keep dancing and while that awkward five or ten seconds is going on, you can never go wrong with a step-touch.  So that's what we're going to show you how to do today.  So, basically, start out with your feet shoulder width apart.  And take your right foot and go step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  And that's it.  That's what you could do when the deejay stops.\n\nAva:  You can even add a snap if you want, or a head, snake it out, go down and up.\n\nLoretta:  You can pretty much do whatever you want with this move. You can put your arms up, bring them down, anything you want.  Just remember two things during that five or ten seconds while the deejay is mixing, keep moving, keep dancing, keep the party going.  And that's how you dance when the deejay is mixing."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M46S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "267661", "likeCount": "598", "dislikeCount": "174", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "23"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/05qjc", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg", "/m/019_rr", "/m/03glg"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "lRYXdrme7cdbiieskuZSQgjM8Hs", "id": "_1mn1T2_6UY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-22T01:28:20Z", "channelId": "UCxZMOY2RdtK6LQUbIYgec4A", "title": "Dance Studio Converts Space For Distance Learning", "description": "Mirror Image Dance Company in Davis moved the dance lessons outside during the pandemic.

Have you ever gone out to a club at night, and your favorite song is on, and you have no idea what to do? Well, with this simple formula I'm going to help you with some dance moves that will get you through your favorite song. \n\nSo I like to call it the Head to Toe. So you start with your head, and then you work all the way down to your feet. Incorporating some really simple dance moves. So you can start with a hair flip, and a shoulder move, and then hips, and then a step touch. Really simple. It looks like you're the best dancer ever, because you're grooving to the beat. But you're just doing four simple steps. Again, that's a hair toss, then a shoulder move, then a hip roll, and then a step together. Okay?\n\nWe can put that all together, and repeat it over and over again, with some variations. And it looks like you're doing an amazing dance, but you're just moving from your head, your shoulders, your hips, to your feet. Okay? Let's try it all together. So head. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. One more time. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch.

What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance to house music. The basic thing when we're dancing to house is really just be in the moment, and love it and just be in it, and just really be free. \n\nAnthony:  So house music has a bunch of different varieties. You have the different beats, you have the different sounds, and you have the different rhythms. But if you keep on the rhythm and keep the bounce in your feet and always be free and let it come to you, you'll be fine dancing to house music.\n\nNow the step I'm going to teach you guys today is the cross hit. We're going to do it slow. We're going to jump and hit, and we're going to cross our feet. Left foot coming forward, right foot going back to start. Ready? Cross and hit, now you're going to switch feet. You're right foot is going to come forward and you're left is going to go back. Ready? Cross hit, and we're going to do that four times, really slow. \n\nReady? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit. Now if you want to speed it up, you can. If you want to stay at this pace, you're more than welcome to. So we're going to stay at this pace, and just do it eight times really quick, so you guys can see the basics. \n\nRight foot is going to go behind first, left foot is going to go forward and we're going to cross and hit. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, and cross hit. So since we just taught you the steps about the cross hit, I'm going to teach you about the arms. \n\nIt's the same kind of thing. When we cross, right foot going back, left going forward, we're going to cross our arms and then open them out. Cross them again and open them out. So this when you pair them together, gives you more of like a rhythm and a feel, and it really gets you loose,  instead of just doing this the whole time. You kind of almost look like an Irish dancer. But if you have some flow into it and you're really able to pop, you'll be able to make it a lot more efficient, and a lot more people looking at you.\n\nLoretta:  Absolutely.\n \nAnthony:  So we're going to do this four times; five six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; and  that's how you dance to house music.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMOjP8yqlvc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["howcast", "dance", "dancing", "dance video", "how to dance", "dance moves", "dance tutorial", "dance videos", "dance step", "house music"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Dance to House Music | Beginner Dancing", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhxI-A93uUIOuv57jJ8fCm6\n-\n-\nLearning to Dance?

My name's Loretta and this is Ava.  We're the Double Time Twins and today we're going to teach you how to dance when you're at the club and the deejay is mixing.  Usually there's maybe five, maybe ten seconds depending on where you are when the deejay is scratching, when you're not really sure what kind of songs are going to come on next.\n\nAva:  And if you're with your friends in a group, it could be an awkward five or ten seconds.  Everyone's standing in a circle like . . .\n\nBoth:  . . . \"cool, wonder what they're going to play next.  I wonder what's going on.  What's going on?  I don't know, I don't know.\"  \n\nAva:  And then the song kicks in and you're like, \"oh my God, that's my song.\"  \n\nLoretta:  So, basically, two things to remember is to just keep moving, keep dancing and while that awkward five or ten seconds is going on, you can never go wrong with a step-touch.  So that's what we're going to show you how to do today.  So, basically, start out with your feet shoulder width apart.  And take your right foot and go step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  And that's it.  That's what you could do when the deejay stops.\n\nAva:  You can even add a snap if you want, or a head, snake it out, go down and up.\n\nLoretta:  You can pretty much do whatever you want with this move. You can put your arms up, bring them down, anything you want.  Just remember two things during that five or ten seconds while the deejay is mixing, keep moving, keep dancing, keep the party going.

Have you ever gone out to a club at night, and your favorite song is on, and you have no idea what to do? Well, with this simple formula I'm going to help you with some dance moves that will get you through your favorite song. \n\nSo I like to call it the Head to Toe. So you start with your head, and then you work all the way down to your feet. Incorporating some really simple dance moves. So you can start with a hair flip, and a shoulder move, and then hips, and then a step touch. Really simple. It looks like you're the best dancer ever, because you're grooving to the beat. But you're just doing four simple steps. Again, that's a hair toss, then a shoulder move, then a hip roll, and then a step together. Okay?\n\nWe can put that all together, and repeat it over and over again, with some variations. And it looks like you're doing an amazing dance, but you're just moving from your head, your shoulders, your hips, to your feet. Okay? Let's try it all together. So head. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. One more time. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch.
