We're going to show you how to do a dance that we call The Happy Feet. You've got to try this out. It's pretty fun. It gets a little complicated somewhere in there, but it gets fun. Check out the feet. All right, so what's going to happen is your right foot is going to be on the heel and you turn it out and then the left foot is going to be on the toe, and you turn that heel in. \n\nSo, basically, both heels come forward, right? So when they start back again, the right foot is on the heel and the left foot is on the toe. In your mind you're thinking heel, toe, but this is a lot different than that. This is The Happy Feet, right? \n\nSo, you're going to turn your right foot, it's going to be on the heel and you turn the toe out. Then you turn the left foot, which is going to be on the toe, you turn that heel in. So both heels come forward and you have one going out and one going in. That's what it looks like when you're standing still. It looks like this, six, seven, eight, hit, bring it back down and then you go the other way, the complete opposite of what you did before. Go. \n\nNow, bring it back down. Now, let's explain the other side. So, hit it and hold it. You have your left on your heel, the left went out, the right on the toe, and that came in. Again, you have both of your heels forward. Got it? Bring it down. \n\nOkay, so let's go to the left again. Left is on the heel, it went out. Right is on the toe, it came in. Got it? Bring it down. So let's go really slow, right and then left. Six, seven, eight, they go right side, stop. Then you go left side, stop. That's what it looks like. It gets a little complicated, but we'll do it slow one more time. Okay? \n\nYou'll see that both of their knees are bent. So you've got to make sure you have bent knees throughout this. So they're going to go right is on the heel, left was on the toe, bring it down. You come to the left side. Left is on the heel, right is on the toe, bring it down. You got it, ladies? \n\nUnknown: Yeah. \n\nJeff: Want to try it slow? It looks like this, six, seven, eight, they go out, down, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. In between they keep stopping. All right? So they're going to go right, stop. Left, stop. Right, stop. Left, stop. When you bend your knees it's a lot easier and it's easier to hold your balance. \n\nSo look at their knees, watch how their knees are bent, and you have one heel, one toe. If you stay like that you're good. Let's try it. Let's speed it up a little bit. Six, seven, eight, they go out, in, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, there you go. That's Happy Feet. Got it? Let's try it to the music. Hey, Happy Feet. Hey. Hands, do whatever you want. Have a good time. Hey.

Go. \n\nNow, bring it back down. Now, let's explain the other side. So, hit it and hold it. You have your left on your heel, the left went out, the right on the toe, and that came in. Again, you have both of your heels forward. Got it? Bring it down. \n\nOkay, so let's go to the left again. Left is on the heel, it went out. Right is on the toe, it came in. Got it? Bring it down. So let's go really slow, right and then left. Six, seven, eight, they go right side, stop. Then you go left side, stop. That's what it looks like. It gets a little complicated, but we'll do it slow one more time. Okay? \n\nYou'll see that both of their knees are bent. So you've got to make sure you have bent knees throughout this. So they're going to go right is on the heel, left was on the toe, bring it down. You come to the left side. Left is on the heel, right is on the toe, bring it down. You got it, ladies? \n\nUnknown: Yeah. \n\nJeff: Want to try it slow? It looks like this, six, seven, eight, they go out, down, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. In between they keep stopping. All right? So they're going to go right, stop. Left, stop. Right, stop. Left, stop. When you bend your knees it's a lot easier and it's easier to hold your balance. \n\nSo look at their knees, watch how their knees are bent, and you have one heel, one toe. If you stay like that you're good. Let's try it. Let's speed it up a little bit. Six, seven, eight, they go out, in, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, there you go. That's Happy Feet. Got it? Let's try it to the music. Hey, Happy Feet. Hey. Hands, do whatever you want. Have a good time. Hey.

So this is something that you definitely want to learn how to do. \n\nFirst thing is a guy and a girl would touch each other. So placement is crucial, right? So girls hands go on the guys shoulder and the guy's hands go on her hips. Make sure it's not too low or not too high, okay?  So basic thing, step touch, step together; step together, step together, step together, awesome.\n\nAva:  Keep going.\n\nLoretta:  Yeah. Now you see how it's easy. They're not too close, they're not too far and a big thing is eye contact. \n\nAva:  Yes, you want to make sure you're connecting with the person that you're talking to and not looking around. Make sure that they know that you're interested and you're having a good time. \n\nAnthony:  Now for guys, big thing you can do when you feel like the dance is just getting a little too normal.  Simple little spin, spice it up, maybe a kiss on the hand and the last thing, a nice little dip.  \n\nLoretta:  Oh, guys if you do that, you've got her in the palm of your hand, all right?\n\nAva:  All right, let's go over those moves from the top.\n\nLoretta:  So if you do it all together. Here we go, step together; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Then Anthony can turn her, maybe give her a kiss or a dip, and then kiss her hand,  and then you're good to go.
