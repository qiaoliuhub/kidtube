If you learn to read music and you learn your scales, you can play any song put in front of you. Same type of thing when it comes to the different styles of swing. If you understand some basic swing elements you can put them together a lot like Legos to make up the different style of swing. Some of those elements are walking, touch-stepping, triple stepping, and kick-ball-changes. Let's just do that in place. \n\nJust walk in place. Doesn't matter what foot you start with, just walk. Feel what that walking rhythm feels like. Now we want to make sure we're over our feet, not back here marching behind our feet, right? We're dancing over our feet, right? So there's walking. \n\nThen there's touch-stepping. Touch, step, touch, step. When get comfortable touch-stepping don't just do it underneath you. Touch to the side, touch forward and back. Get comfortable just moving around. \n\nAnd then of course we have our triple steps as well. Triple step underneath you, right? Triple step going sideways. I would even triple step going forward and back. Right? Just getting comfortable with what that rhythm feels like. \n\nThen we have our kick-ball-change. Kick, ball (it's the ball of the foot), change. From the side that goes kick, ball change, kick, ball change. You can even do it with both feet. Kick, ball change, kick, ball change. Again, kick, ball change, kick, ball change. \n\nIf you don't pick the foot up it's touch-ball-change. Touch, ball change, touch, ball change, as opposed to a kick-ball-change. Some movement, just looks a little bit different because I'm not picking the foot up. So we're going to go ahead and take those elements and put them to music.

Jenny, Adley and Niko Bear found some awesome bats that go perfect for the holiday and decide to hang them on the door. Adley, being the loving little girl that she is, groups them in families and names them after all of us. \n\nOnce the door is all decorated, the find me downstairs so they can show me the great job that they did. After decorations, Adley comes up with a brand new game called statue! the rules are easy, Adley and Niko are statues, Jenny sells them, and I buy them. But they are crazy. The Adley statue moves around when I'm not looking while the Niko Bear statue has a button to make it come a live and run around the room. haha I love pretend play with the kiddos!!\n\nWith the new game done, I have to show you guys a new trick that the kiddos and I learned. We can hang from the ceiling in the kitchen!! It's hilarious, though Jenny wishes we didn't use the house like a park toy. We then head to the backyard splash pad to find some rocks for arts and crafts time.\n\nWe love doing little DIY creative projects with the kiddos, but these are extra special, because we are going to take these rocks to the construction site of a brand new LDS Temple. These temples are super important to us, so its awesome that we get to put little memories into the foundation. Adley draws pretty flowers, Niko colors his rock so good, and Jenny makes a cute rock for her and baby Navey and I make a rock about our family and how much we love each other. ( Also with a little pirate theme for pirate island lol)\n\nAfter dropping of the rocks and doing some work at the lake lot, I'm home for the night! I also brought gifts for the whole family. We have A for Adley shirts again!! We have a brand new company making them and they look so good. The colors are bright, the images look great, and we are excited to share them with you guys again!!

Jenny, Adley and Niko Bear found some awesome bats that go perfect for the holiday and decide to hang them on the door. Adley, being the loving little girl that she is, groups them in families and names them after all of us. \n\nOnce the door is all decorated, the find me downstairs so they can show me the great job that they did. After decorations, Adley comes up with a brand new game called statue! the rules are easy, Adley and Niko are statues, Jenny sells them, and I buy them. But they are crazy. The Adley statue moves around when I'm not looking while the Niko Bear statue has a button to make it come a live and run around the room. haha I love pretend play with the kiddos!!\n\nWith the new game done, I have to show you guys a new trick that the kiddos and I learned. We can hang from the ceiling in the kitchen!! It's hilarious, though Jenny wishes we didn't use the house like a park toy. We then head to the backyard splash pad to find some rocks for arts and crafts time.\n\nWe love doing little DIY creative projects with the kiddos, but these are extra special, because we are going to take these rocks to the construction site of a brand new LDS Temple. These temples are super important to us, so its awesome that we get to put little memories into the foundation. Adley draws pretty flowers, Niko colors his rock so good, and Jenny makes a cute rock for her and baby Navey and I make a rock about our family and how much we love each other. ( Also with a little pirate theme for pirate island lol)\n\nAfter dropping of the rocks and doing some work at the lake lot, I'm home for the night! I also brought gifts for the whole family. We have A for Adley shirts again!! We have a brand new company making them and they look so good. The colors are bright, the images look great, and we are excited to share them with you guys again!! Prices are still the same, we want them to be easy for you to get. If you bought a shirt before and there were problems with it, we want to help. After unboxing the surprise, it's time to start our bed time routine and end this amazing Best Day Ever!!\n\n\\\\\\\\\nWatch Adley's last video: ADLEY finds a PET DiNOSAUR!!

Children dance to an integrated curriculum of vocabulary, phonics, compound words and words\u2014all while having a blast and appearing on your TV screen!\n\nChildren will love to dance, sing and see themselves on the TV screen. Walk, wiggle, shake and shimmy to action verbs. Swing both arms and punch the Compound Word Dance Machine button to make compound words. Beat on the drum to complete Doodleburg rhymes. Dance to percussive beats between rhymes. Soar, spin, shake, reach and run to mimic the pterodactyl\u2019s actions. Dance like feathers in the breeze to see a flying feather pattern on screen, twirl and shake for more fun visuals. Reach up and smack fruits\u2014big and small, green and purple, striped and bumpy\u2014based on the adjectives. The camera puts children on center stage where their body motion controls the gameplay. \n\nDance and Learn combines dancing and singing with seamlessly embedded early literacy curriculum for a truly joyful and invigorating reading rumpus. Play the games in a random sequence, select specific games or customize a set of dances for an educational and dynamic dance party! Children can play with family or friends in multiplayer mode or keep the spotlight for solo dancing. Whichever way they play, it\u2019s sure to spell active fun! (Multiplayer feature requires a single controller.)\n\nLeapFrog creates award-winning educational solutions that delight, engage and inspire children to reach their potential.

Children dance to an integrated curriculum of vocabulary, phonics, compound words and words\u2014all while having a blast and appearing on your TV screen!\n\nChildren will love to dance, sing and see themselves on the TV screen. Walk, wiggle, shake and shimmy to action verbs. Swing both arms and punch the Compound Word Dance Machine button to make compound words. Beat on the drum to complete Doodleburg rhymes. Dance to percussive beats between rhymes. Soar, spin, shake, reach and run to mimic the pterodactyl\u2019s actions. Dance like feathers in the breeze to see a flying feather pattern on screen, twirl and shake for more fun visuals. Reach up and smack fruits\u2014big and small, green and purple, striped and bumpy\u2014based on the adjectives. The camera puts children on center stage where their body motion controls the gameplay. \n\nDance and Learn combines dancing and singing with seamlessly embedded early literacy curriculum for a truly joyful and invigorating reading rumpus. Play the games in a random sequence, select specific games or customize a set of dances for an educational and dynamic dance party! Children can play with family or friends in multiplayer mode or keep the spotlight for solo dancing. Whichever way they play, it\u2019s sure to spell active fun! (Multiplayer feature requires a single controller.)\n\nLeapFrog creates award-winning educational solutions that delight, engage and inspire children to reach their potential. We know that children learn best when they\u2019re having fun, and that every child learns differently.
