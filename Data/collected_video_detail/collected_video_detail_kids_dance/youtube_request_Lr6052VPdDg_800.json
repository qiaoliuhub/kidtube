This is a very short pattern. You are going to start to the left on one, two, three, tap, five, six, seven. Then you're going to go outside and middle, top, outside and middle, top, outside and middle, top. Outside and forward, for one,two, three and slide six.\n\nAnd basic and one, two, three. Half to the right, half to the left, and five, six, seven. Now let's break it down. This pattern is going to start with the basics, so lets do the basic first, five, six, seven and one, two, three tap, five, six, seven break from here. We're going to push the weight to the outside, open step, middle break. Then we're going to do it on the other side. Open step, middle break. Gentleman, notice how my shoulders are rolling as I go out. Open,step. \n\nDaniela: And ladies don't forget your hips. They're going out and tap. \n\nEdwin: And gentlemen, make sure that you use the same distance that you're going to the left, also to the right. Now the next part is going to go forward, you're going to lead with your left leg in front. Five, six, seven and one, two, tap behind and slide. Lets try that again. And one, two, tap behind and slide. \n\nSo make sure you're dragging out your foot as much as you can, up to the last number and then we go to the left. So now we're going to do the last part. And one, two, three, tap. Here you want to have your foot in front of you, because your going to lead yourself forward into a twist. So you're going to go, twist to the right, tap and same thing, twist to the left, tap and basic to the right. \n\nNow lets put it together a little bit faster and then with music, five, six, seven, eight and one, two, three, tap, five, six, seven, tap. Outside stomp, middle, outside stomp, middle, outside and outside, now forward and one, two, tap behind and slide. And basic step, twist to the right, twist to the left and five, six, seven, eight. Make sure your confident and secure. Now let's try it with music.  \n\nDaniela: Ladies remember your hips, also you can style. \n\nEdwin: And gentlemen, shoulders.

Today, we're talking about the four elements of the cha-cha basic. Our first element is what we call walking steps. Forward and backward. Forward, forward, forward, just as simple as that, and replacing back where we came from. And walk, walk, walk and back, back, back. Just as easy as walking down the street. \n\nNow with our cha-cha we're going to be talking about a little bit of a different kind of quality of action, this being a dance that's come over from Cuba in the late 1940's. We're going to add a little bit of a Cuban action to this and place more emphasis, on putting our weight on the balls of our feet. So we're going to dance this forward a little bit more. One, two, three and back again, one, two, three. \n\nNow our second element of the cha-cha basic is going to be a side step. We're going to start in this dance with our left foot and we're going to start side, together, side, together, side. And just the same back in the direction we were coming from, to our right. Side, together, side, together, side. Again, with a little bit of that Cuban action, as well. Side, together, side, together. Really digging down and back where we came from, to our right. Again, side, together, side, together, side. \n\nChristina:  And the last element we're going to talk about is the rock step. You take your left foot and you're just going to place it behind you. You're going to step back and put your weight back on your right foot. So weight on the left foot, weight on the right foot, and again, we're going to add that Cuban hip motion in. You're going to step back and replace forward, back, replace, back, replace. \n\nThe trick to this move is, I'll show you from the side. You want to keep the movement underneath your body, so you don't want to think of stepping back and forward. You want to keep it very small. It's just going to be right underneath your body, back and forward, back and forward. Great.\n\nAaron:  Okay, guys. So just to recap, the four elements of the cha-cha basic were; walking steps, forward, backward, sidesteps and the fourth element, the rock step. Now we're going to take those, and put those together, and make up our cha-cha basic. Just like so, side, rock, step, side, together, side, rock, step, side together side, rock, step. Now forward and backward with the walking steps,cha-cha-cha, rock, step, cha-cha-cha, rock, step and side, together, side. \n\nFive, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two. Cha-cha, one, two, three, forward, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, side together, side.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PWiLi22Cq8w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PWiLi22Cq8w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PWiLi22Cq8w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PWiLi22Cq8w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PWiLi22Cq8w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "HowcastArtsRec", "tags": ["howcast", "cha-cha-cha", "cha-cha", "cha-cha dance", "cha-cha step", "basic cha-cha", "cha-cha dance lesson", "cha-cha music"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "4 Basic Elements of Cha-Cha | Cha-Cha Dance", "description": "Like these Ballroom Dance Lessons !!!
