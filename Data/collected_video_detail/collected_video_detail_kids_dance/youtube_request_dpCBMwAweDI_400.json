Today we start out with a tour of our newest basement fort neighborhood. This one is extra special because it has our own backyard, toy and relaxation rooms for each of us, plus our very own backyard! But you have to be careful in the backyard, if you do the animal call, wild animals will show up and it's scary!! After playing that with the kiddos all morning, Jenny comes down to see what this mornings routine has looked like. \n\nWe are way into craft time these days and today we have the plan to make some DIY cup phones! The kiddos and I sit at the kitchen table and start decorating our phones, making silly faces for them and connecting them with string.

My name is Tweet Boogie. I represent the South Bronx, had my first hip-hop crew at fourteen, done some work with Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child, traveled all over the world cause I teach hip-hop culture, and right now I'm ready to teach you some dances for the club. Let's get it started. So, my time to shine, sexy dance moves for women.  Ladies, we're going to do the dip, and move your hip. Right? So, I need your feet together, and I'm going to stand at an angle so you can see it. So, feet together, place your hands on your thighs, and bend your knees. You might want to arch just a little bit. Just a little bit to keep the silhouette cute. So what you're going to do is bend your knees, and as you bend your knees your hips are going to go to the right. Boom. And, we're going to dip again, and you're going to go to the left. Dip to the left. You see how I'm still arched? You don't want to be straight because then you look surprised, ooh. So you want to stay arched. So you want to dip again. Dip again to the left. Dip again to the right. I'm going to try my sexy moves on my partner over here. So come on over here to me. Good. Are you ready?\r\n\r\nI'm ready.\r\n\r\nSo, OK, usually when a guy watches a female do this dip, there's really nothing that he would do except for a two-step, which would be from side to side. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So really you let the female do all the work. But don't just stand there looking at her, gawking at her. So you got to do a simple two-step, right? Boom. So we're going to try this with music so I can get my sexy on. DJ! Good, so now I'm going to take it low on him. Good.  Make sure that you keep the arch in your back. Good, and dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. Good, I think my partner is dipping with me. Yes he is! Good, dip, dip, dip, dip. You might want to look at him. How you doing? Yeah he's back there.

You have to start with your knees bent, on your tippy-toes, is the best way to start. Knees in, knees out, think of yourself doing the Thighmaster exercise. Knees in, knees out, knees in, knees out. Now, how do we get to the butterfly? We add our pelvis. When your knees come in, your pelvis pushes your knees apart, and your pelvis goes back. Knees in, push the knees apart. Knees in, pelvis pushes the knees apart, and push, and open, and push, and open. Now you can add your arms, for a scooping motion, to add onto the butterfly.\n\nSo, let's do a single-leg, single-leg, double-leg butterfly. We're going to start with the right. Right leg,  left leg,  now both go two times. Right leg again. Right leg, left leg, both legs. Make sure you're pushing, push! Push! Both legs. One more time. Right, left, push. Good. So now Victor and I are going to show you how you can partner up into a butterfly with your friends. So I'm going to do a low butterfly, Victor's going to be high. We're going to go single, single, double. Ready, Victor?\n\nYes.\n\n5, 6, 7, you have single, single, and double. One more time. Single, single, and double. Awesome.

What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava, and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance at a high school dance. So really, Monday through Friday, you're in high school and you're in class, you're at lunch. You know you're learning, you're studying, you're working, right? So time when you get to high school dance, you want to just have fun. So we're going to show you three moves that you could do to have fun and dance with your friends. \n\nAnthony: You just let loose. Let loose and have a good time.\n\nAva: That's what it's all about, right?\n\nLoretta: Okay, so the first move is just a basic, say you have three friends, right? It's a guy and two girls, okay? We could just do a basic snake, and a step touch, and everyone goes to the right, okay? Five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, that's fun and interacting. You're hanging out with your friends. It's something just simple, cool and easy. \n\nAnthony: Now the second step that we're going to learn is just a simple step touch, moving around the circle and just having a good time. Keep engaged with your friends and just let loose. High school dances are just about getting away from your studies and having a good time. So let's break it down. We're in a circle; five, six, seven, eight; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip. \n\nAva:  Awesome, so that's the second move that you can do at a high school dance. The third move you could do is when you are in a circle, you guys are all in it together, you could push it down and then breeze through and push down; breeze through and push down, and breeze through and push down, and breeze through.\n\nAva:  Awesome, so those are the three moves that you could do with your friends at a high school dance.

What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava, and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance at a high school dance. So really, Monday through Friday, you're in high school and you're in class, you're at lunch. You know you're learning, you're studying, you're working, right? So time when you get to high school dance, you want to just have fun. So we're going to show you three moves that you could do to have fun and dance with your friends. \n\nAnthony: You just let loose. Let loose and have a good time.\n\nAva: That's what it's all about, right?\n\nLoretta: Okay, so the first move is just a basic, say you have three friends, right? It's a guy and two girls, okay? We could just do a basic snake, and a step touch, and everyone goes to the right, okay? Five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, that's fun and interacting. You're hanging out with your friends. It's something just simple, cool and easy. \n\nAnthony: Now the second step that we're going to learn is just a simple step touch, moving around the circle and just having a good time. Keep engaged with your friends and just let loose. High school dances are just about getting away from your studies and having a good time. So let's break it down. We're in a circle; five, six, seven, eight; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip. \n\nAva:  Awesome, so that's the second move that you can do at a high school dance. The third move you could do is when you are in a circle, you guys are all in it together, you could push it down and then breeze through and push down; breeze through and push down, and breeze through and push down, and breeze through.\n\nAva:  Awesome, so those are the three moves that you could do with your friends at a high school dance. Let's go through them one more time together. So the first move, snake; five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; awesome.\n\nAnthony:  Now our second move is step touch with a circle; five, six, seven eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. \n\nLoretta and Ava: Awesome.\n\nAva:  Third move, push it down, breeze through; five, six, seven, eight.
