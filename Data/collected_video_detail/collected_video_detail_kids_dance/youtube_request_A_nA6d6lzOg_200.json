If your child is an auditory or visual learner, the KT Diddle Show can help them comprehend words and numbers better. \n\nI had dyslexia as a child. It was difficult learning to write, spell, and to keep numbers in order. I would sometimes write my letters backwards or upside down and my numbers would be flipped. I\u2019ve pretty much overcome dyslexia; I make sure to review my work. Together, with a little extra effort, your child can overcome their adversity, just like I did. Join me each week on YouTube. There will be music, colorful pictures, and best of all, puppets! Parents, please be sure to like and subscribe! THANKS! KT Diddle :)\n\nInShot Music/Song: \"December\"\nCreated by InShot:https://inshotapp.com/share/youtube.html"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M58S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "10", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "aPq8GbGi7PQvDriIPjSzsH7nCq0", "id": "Vxa80j3hqzs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-27T03:18:35Z", "channelId": "UCCl5GSpPj3WhqOofKSh4mhw", "title": "MLK Speaks: A Conversation with America", "description": "David Susskind's historical, long and intimate interview with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Originally aired on June 9, 1963 by WPIX-TV New York.
