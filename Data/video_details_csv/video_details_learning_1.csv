1,dktnOPfE7Dc,"Dinosaurs for Kids | Learn about Dinosaur History, Fossils, Dinosaur Extinction and more!","Dinosaurs for Kids,Dinosaurs History,Dinosaurs history for kids,dinosaurs,Clarendon Learning","Dinosaurs for Kids is a fun and comprehensive look at dinosaur history. In this video we highlight the various kinds of dinosaurs, talk about how they receive their names, famous dinosaur fossils, and we talk about the people who find dinosaur fossils: Paleontologists. 

We think that one of the most fascinating creatures to ever roam the Earth was the dinosaur. You most likely have heard of dinosaurs, seen pictures of them on TV or the Internet, or may have seen their bones in a museum. Dinosaurs are an interesting group of animals that no longer exist, meaning they are extinct. Dinosaurs evolved, meaning they changed, over millions of years. 

In this dinosaur for kids video we also talk about how the dinosaurs’ extinction took place about 66 million years ago and 75% of all life on Earth died. There are many theories or guesses as to what may have happened leading to the extinction. They include worldwide volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth’s climate, or perhaps a meteorite from space smashing into the Earth.

LYRICS:

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we’re the smallest ones  

My name is Ceres
And I’m a dwarf planet
and the closest dwarf to the sun
The mysterious white spots on my rocky surface
And I am the smallest one

My name is Pluto
I am a Dwarf planet 
And was the ninth planet from the sun
I am one-third water in the form of ice
And I have five moons that are lots of fun

My names Haumea
I am oval in shape
do to the fast rotations that I make
I take 285 years to orbit the sun 
Because I am so far away

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we’re the smallest ones  

I'm Mah-kee mah-kee
I have no Atmosphere
I was discovered in 2005
I am one of the reasons Pluto lost his status 
So naturally, we do not jive

My name is Eris
I’m more massive than Pluto 
I am big but I’m lots of fun
557 is the number of years 
It takes me to revolve around the sun

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we’re the smallest ones

JOIN OUR FAM!! --- http://goo.gl/rfgp8V

Best Morning Swim Day Ever 1172

The best way to start the morning is with the whole family!! We all gather around Navey to say hello and to start our Chirstmas morning routine of looking for Snowy the Elf on a shelf! She's not playing hide n seek today, because as soon as the kiddos start heading downstairs they see here sitting in on of the windows. Shes surrounded by snowballs? That can mean only one thing...Snowball battle inside our house!! 

After the snowball fight, we look outside and see he huge flock of birds flying through the sky. Adley, Niko Bear, and I run out to watch them and while we're in the backyard we remember that we haven't shown you the new hot tub cover, it's really cool and way easier for the family. Adley says she wants to go swimming this morning, so suprise morning swim in our backyard hot tub. The kiddos do tricks in the water and surf the waves like the would a beach. Jenny and I give you a mini backyard tour with some updates, and we have tons of family fun swimming around!

After the backyard, its time for lunch and cookies while we watch Spacestation Gaming play Rocket League in the RLCS Winter League split. Our guys are doing great. So me and my rocket league buddy/cheerleader/bat head downstairs to watch our boys play. This can also be a great intro for anyone new to SSG or rocket league. While we're watching the game, Jenny and Niko Bear are working on surprise DYI ginger bread trains and barbie dream house. At one point Adley and I almost ruin the surprise when we come upstairs. But Jenny quickly tells us to close our eyes!!

We head back down to watch the grand championship and Niko learns how to gingerbread. Jenny calls us up and Adley is so shocked to see the barbie house!! She and Niko do a great job at decorating the house and train. All those crafts we've been doing have paid off. The kiddos also turn the vlog into a gingerbread camera, and I wish that was jut pretend play lol

Please forward questions that you may have in the comments. I try my best to answer all questions. 

I've included the vanishing toothpick trick here because it's a great one for kids to learn and perform. In my experience, kids love the trick. However, I do understand that a toothpick can be problematic with its sharp points. So please be cautious. One idea is to break the sharp point from the toothpick. If any grown-ups out there come up with a better object for the trick, please comment below so others may benefit.

Girls and boys, I'm Jack Hartmann
Sing along with me and let's learn all different parts of our body

You point to it and shake it, wiggle it, twist it or move it
Any way you want
And sing out

Why can hummingbirds fly sideways and backwards? Do hummingbirds actually use their beak like a straw? Which is the smallest hummingbird species in the world? Do hummingbirds have the fastest wing beat? And do you know which animal is often mistaken for a hummingbird?

Hummingbirds are amazing little birds because they set all kinds of records. The broad-tailed hummingbird lays the smallest eggs in the world, the ruby-throated hummingbird has the fewest feathers of all birds and the blue-throated mountaingem (what a beautiful name!) has the fastest heart beat. That's not nearly all, so just take a look at the video.

In this video you will find interesting facts and information about hummingbirds, for a presentation, a fact file or other homework for school. Don't miss: There is a detailed animal profile on animalfunfacts.net, too!

Edible Weed Walk is planning to launch a crowd funding initiative to re-print book #1 on Edible Weeds; publish book #2 & #3 on Medicinal Weeds and Edible Flowers ; and launch an education initiative to take this near-lost tradition to the next generation
Best educational coloring books for kids however is an subject that I understand something about. This video therefore should matter and of interest to you.

Thinking about how to give your child the best education in the world, but you don't have enough money?
Smart VideoNanny is the answer to all questions!
Smart VideoNanny is a quantum leap in education!
Smart VideoNanny will make your child a universal genius with almost no investment of money, time, or effort!
So far, this project exists only in my head at the level of an idea. But very soon the first prototypes will appear. Time is accelerating! It's up to us!
What is a regular Video Nanny? It is a simple remote video surveillance camera with additional functions that are used by young parents to monitor their children.
What is Smart Video Nanny? What are its differences?
Smart VideoNanny is a powerful educational platform for babies based on regular VideoNanny!
Smart VideoNanny is the same surveillance camera, to which just a few things have been added:
• Video projector
• Night Sky or home planetarium
• Multilingual analyzer and speech synthesizer with AI (Artificial Intelligence)
• And many others.
That is, this is already the next generation VideoNanny. Which will not only follow the kids but also teach them from birth to 5-6 years!
A bit of theory
Did you know that in newborns, the brain is only 25% of that of an adult, and it is not yet formed? And that its most active growth (more than 60% of the volume) and the formation of a neural network of brain synapses occurs at the earliest age during the first 12 months?
Synaptogenesis is the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system. Although it occurs throughout a healthy person's lifespan, an explosion of synapse formation occurs during early brain development, known as exuberant synaptogenesis (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
And in order for the brain to develop harmoniously, and the neural network of synapses to grow as much as possible, it needs information, a lot of information, and the more information there is, the better!
Because information is food for brain development. Without information, the brain starves and remains underdeveloped.
Did you know that cognitive abilities, that is, the ability to absorb Knowledge, are at their maximum in newborns, after which they fall in the opposite exponential manner? As we age, it becomes increasingly difficult for us to memorize and assimilate new material, and our cognitive abilities tend to zero. This can be seen in the example of language learning. Babies do not learn languages — they immediately begin to speak them at the maternal level. How to turn on the bulbs of the Christmas garland, or hang Christmas balls on the Christmas tree
This graph shows that when we go to school, we can assimilate Knowledge 3 times worse than newborns.
And many other reasons convince us that it is necessary to start the education of our babies right from birth, from the very first day of life. And our Smart VideoNanny will help us with this. Therefore, our task as caring parents is to create and launch into mass production the Smart VideoNanny.
Now let's look at exactly how Smart VideoNanny will teach kids.
Today, the usual VideoNanny can sing to babies only a few songs and lullabies in the manufacturer's language.
And if you complicate the task and make the Smart Video Nanny sing songs and lullabies in 20+ languages? After all, then the children will begin to speak fluently in all these 20+ languages at the mother's level! Of course, lullabies alone will not be enough for a confident command of 20+ languages, but the main idea is already clear.
And if you complicate the task even more and add a couple more channels of information? Overlay nature sounds? And then we will immediately receive a huge amount of information:
• Sounds of nature
• Sounds of music
• Quiet human speech
During the first month of newborns, only one channel “works” for receiving information — the auditory channel. Unfortunately, we do not think about it, so most often our kids hear some kind of informational garbage, i.e. frightening and unpleasant sounds from the street, from the TV, from the people around them, and on the basis of all this, their brain is formed.
I propose to sensibly approach the “loading” of this so important auditory channel and surround the baby in the first month of his life with only the most pleasant, harmonious, and soothing sounds. You just need to combine the murmur of water and the singing of birds with the Far Eastern music — and overlay the reading of the ""Tao Te Ching"" in the original. And all these programs will be formed according to the choice and preferences of the parents.
And so with all 20+ languages. As you can see, it is not difficult, and Smart VideoNanny can easily cope with this task. Thanks to this, his brain will begin to form much more harmoniously, and the baby himself will be calmer.",\'Learning Videos for Kids\',true

0,ZnNloeoFZEU,Man's Best Friend,[],"'Man's Best Friend' is a unique story. There is nothing like it on the film market today. The story touches upon an array of societal issues. From Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other emotional and psychological challenges; physical wounds and horrific disfigurement of military veterans; homelessness and veterans/families struggling at the poverty level; and, abuse and mistreatment of animals (specifically canines); to disrespectful, self-entitled, troubled teens; and, the arrogance of 'perceived privilege' by those in positions of power. 'Man's Best Friend' is redemptive – not always in the traditional sense - as it reaches for balance among its wide-array of characters. The narrative strives to expose the darkness of man's inhumanity yet embraces the goodness in the hearts of others.",\'Learning Videos for Kids\',true

3.  There is a repeat section with low-volume guide track.
4.  Tambourine has been added to the mix to help keep learners on the beat.
5.  ""ng"" and ""nk"" blends have been eliminated (technically fall under the category of digraphs).
6.  tw-twins and pr-prince have been added while sw-swim has replaced swimsuit and sweater.
7. ""gloves"" has been changed to singular ""glove.""
8.  All words are single syllable.

Includes Consonant Blends:
bl - black
br - brown
cl - clap
cr - crab
pl - plant

nd - and ELF Learning creates learning materials for kids all over the world.  Based in Japan, we publish books, CDs, DVDs and of course...learning videos!

Our videos are designed for children ages 2~10 and cover a wide range of topics.  

Our song videos are a mix of original and classic children's songs.  We try hard to add the ELF touch - clear vocals, different genres and lots of cool instruments.  

Our learning videos cover vocabulary, phrases and patterns perfect for the ESL and EFL classroom. 

Many of our videos work well with special needs children, especially those with Autistic Disorder, Speech and Language Impairments and Speech, Reading and Learning Disabilities.  We often receive emails from parents thanking us for helping their child learn to speak or read and each time it makes our day!

Mom and dad both play guitar a little bit, so the kids got little kid-sized guitars for them to start playing and learning how to play. In order to hold their attention so they don't get frustrated with having to strum while also learning where their fingers go to play chords, ChordBuddy was cool enough to send us two guitars that use their ChordBuddy system for making easy for anyone to pick up a guitar and instantly start playing their favorite songs. It worked for our kids!

Lyrics:

Hello I’m your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

As a baby you start out 
with about 300 different bones
That's a lot considering many fuse  
when you are grown
206 bones is what 
you have as an adult
Do to all the fusion
your bones do this is the result
Ligaments hold the ends 
of your bones together this is true
And Muscles attach to bone
with Tendons connective tissue 
Tendons and Ligaments connect 
to bones on either side of a joint
Holding bones together tightly
That is the point
Bone Marrow’s a soft and spongy tissue 
found inside some bones
Bone Morrow Stroma Stem Cells are called 
Mesenchymal 
Mesenchymal Stem cells are the two colors 
Yellow and Red
The yellow color produces fat, bone 
and your cartilage 
The Red color produces white and 
red blood cells 
It also makes the Platelets that cause clotting
to stop bleeding well

Hello I’m your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here’s some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

Let's focus on some of the major bones
in the human body
We’ll start at the top of the cranium
which is called your Skull you see
Then we’ll move down to your 
Mandible it helps you chew food 
Onto the Clavicle also called The
Collarbone on you
Here we have the Sternum
Which connects all your Ribs
Here’s the Pelvis it’s your midsection
which gives you your hips
Connected to your Pelvis is the 
biggest bone in the body
It’s called the Femur and it is also 
the strongest bone you’ll see
Right below are the Tibia and the Fibula
on you
They work together to hold your feet on
your body this is true 
Let's not forget that Humerus 
Bone on the upper arm
It’s attached to the Radius and Ulna
that form your forearm 
Your hand is made up of about
27 bones
We’ll focus on those in another one of my 
songs catchy tones

Hello I’m your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

Let's move to the Posterior
or the backside of you
The first thing you’ll notice is the 
Spinal Column I'll break that down too
The Cervical Vertebrae 
also known as your neck
Is made up of 7 bones
to help keep your head in check
Then the Thoracic Vertebrae 
Is made up of 12 bones
It’s the longest stretch of your 
the spinal column that is shown
Then there's the Lumbar Vertebrae
on your lower back
It’s an arch and a very 
important bony stack
Onto your Sacrum, it's attached
to your Pelvis
Then the spine ends with the fusion of bones 
called the Coccyx 
Please take care of your bones 
and keep them healthy and strong
They give you the structure in your life 
to help you live really long

Hello I’m your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body

Lyrics:
The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the waterspout.
Down came the rain and
Washed the spider out.

Out came the sun and
Dried up all the rain,
And the itsy bitsy spider 
Went up the spout again.

The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the waterspout.
Down came the rain and
Washed the spider out.

Out came the sun and
Dried up all the rain,
And the itsy bitsy spider 
Went up the spout again.",\'Learning Videos for Kids\',true

A digraph is when two letter sounds or phonemes combine to make one sound or phoneme.  When the /s/ sound combines with the /h/ sound they create the unique sound of /sh/.
   Learn about the ""sh"" digraph  as you listen to the sh sound and sing along with the storyboards  that begin and end with the sh digraph.

These 3D shapes are clearly shown, with examples of real-life 3D shapes.

My 3D SHAPES song is very sing-able and memorable for all children. Kids will be able to sing the five common 3D shapes after listening to this song and always remember them. The vividly clear visual images for each 3D shape will help them to identify 3D shapes in their environment.

Kids will get to see four beautiful real-life photos for each of the five 3D shapes. The 3D shapes I show are shapes they see every day and everywhere.

Use this song to strengthen and enhance your math curriculum and your teaching of 3D shapes.

*A 3D shape is a geometric figure that has three (3) dimensions; height, width and depth.

*3D shapes differ from 2D shapes because they have thickness.

*They are often thought of as solids, but can also be hollow like an empty box.

*3D shapes are classified by the number and size of their faces, the number of their vertices, and by the number and size of their edges.

*Faces - these are the flat parts of the 3D shape.

*Edges - these are the sides of the faces, where the two faces meet.

*Vertices - these are the corners or points of the shape.
 
I hope teachers, parents and children will sing this 3D shapes song and use this video regularly to help develop awareness and knowledge about the geometry of 3D shapes and all the 3D shapes around us.

LYRICS:

3 D Shapes

The syllable song is clear and catchy and it engages children with not only visuals of the words, but also fun movements (clapping, stomping and chomping with their arms.)  This syllable song is perfect for kinesthetic (visual) learners.  They participate with singing (auditory) seeing the words (visual) and doing the movements, clap, stomp and chomp to each syllable (kinesthetic.)
Your children can also participate by counting out loud the number of syllables in each word that is presented as they are clapping, stomping and chomping.  Counting the syllables can easily be included in this activity.
Syllabication is an important skill in developing phonological awareness which is essential to helping our children become successful readers.
Your children will have fun clapping, stomping and chomping as they get great practice hearing the syllables in words. This song engages active participation while building brain and body connections.

~ The Suez Canal in Egypt is a waterway in the ocean.
~ Cities along the ocean include Mumbai, India; Perth, Australia;
and Singapore.
~ Many endangered species live here such as turtles and seals.

Arctic Ocean: Located around the North Pole across the Arctic circle
~ Home to many of the Polar Bears of the world.
~ Smallest ocean and most shallow, but is the coldest.
~ Sometimes called the “frozen ocean”, almost completely covered in ice during the winter,

This video helps adults and kids learn bird sounds with high-quality bird footage in HD. In the first part of our series, you will learn the sounds of common city bird and fowls.
Subscribe to Kiddopedia channel for more videos →  https://goo.gl/O1jdcO

Children are very interested in animals and birds.  Children learn birds at the preschool age by listening to birds sounds and seeing them with their own eyes. This video fulfills this educational purpose perfectly by using close-up video footage of common birds and fowls.

Birds use their voices to communicate with other birds. Birds can sing at any time of day, but their songs are often louder, livelier, and more frequent during the dawn. In most bird species, only male birds sing, attempting to attract mates and warn other males away from their territories.Not all of the bird noises are attractive to your ears. Some of the birds sing very pleasantly, whereas some of the birds make loud and not so pretty sounds for the human ear. Bird identification is a fun and useful skill, as bird sounds are a part of our lives in the cities and in nature. 

Fowl definition: A fowl is a bird, such as a duck, goose, turkey, or pheasant, that is used as food or hunted as game.

Common city birds: Cities harbor 20% of the world's bird species. You can hear these birds while you are walking in the streets or parks of your city.These are the birds can be found in the backyards. They can also be called garden birds.

Dancing Robots
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
DANCING ROBOTS 3:57
Directions: This a dance where you imitate a dancing robot. It is performed with small jerks to give the impression of motors 
starting and stopping. Keep your posture stiff at all times. When you are directed to stop, stay as motionless as possible. During
the malfunction imitate a 'broken robot', slowly bend at your waist and then powering up again . The dance concludes with the
'broken robot'. Using exaggerated jerking motions and a look of confusion on your face as you drop towards the ground give the
impression that the robot has completely ceased to function.

Robot: ""Tummy in, shoulders back""
Refrain:
Robots stand still. We'll stand up straight not moving.
We'll move then stop. It's hard to bend that steel.
We're stiff and straight with every little motion.
We're just machines but we certainly look real.
Raise your right hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Raise your left hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. (2X)
Now turn your head to the right a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head to the left a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. (2X)
Robot: ""Stop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a
grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.""
1,2,3,4
Repeat Refrain
Raise your right leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Raise your left leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop CONTINUED NEXT PAGE
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, moving all around. (5X)
Robot: ""Break down, Robot tired, must take rest. See you later.""

Going on a Bear Hunt lyrics:
[children repeat each line]

Going on a bear hunt 
Gonna see a big one 
I'm not scared

Uh-Oh! 
Tall grass!
Can't go around it
Can't go over it 
Can't go under it
We have to go through it 
Swish! Swish! Swish! 
 
Going on a bear hunt 
Gonna see a big one 
I'm not scared

Uh-oh! 
A river! 
Can't go around it
Can't go over it 
Can't go under it
We have to go through it 
Splash! Splash! Splash! 

Going on a bear hunt 
Gonna see a big one 
I'm not scared
 
Uh-oh! 
Mud! 
Can't go around it
Can't go over it 
Can't go under it
We have to go through it 
Squish! Squish! Squish!  

Going on a bear hunt 
Gonna see a big one 
I'm not scared
 
Uh-oh! 
A cave! 
Can't go around it
Can't go over it 
Can't go under it
We have to go through it 
Step! Step! Step! 

WHAT’S THAT?
One wet nose 
Two furry ears
Two big eyes!

Uh-oh! 
IT’S A BEAR!

Quick!

Back through the cave
Step! Step! Step!

Back through the mud 
Squish! Squish! Squish!

Back through the river! 
Splash! Splash! Splash!

Back through the grass! 
Swish! Swish! Swish! 

Run back home 
Open the door
Run inside 
Close the door
Whew! Safe at last!

We went on a bear hunt
And we saw a big one

I wasn't scared...
    Well, maybe just a little bit.

Lyrics: 

Bobby the magaician bear, decided to go for an adventure.

An Advenutre to the planets

Lets’ learn about all the planets.
The solar system is really an exciting place.
The sun is the center of solar system.

The first person to set foot on the Moon was Neil Armstrong.


The smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury and the largest planet is Jupiter.

Earth is where we live.

This red planet is called mars.

Venus is the brightest planet.

Saturn has beautiful rings that go round and round.

Uranus and Neptune are dark, cold, and very windy.


Which is your favourite planet?

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

(Snowflakes is an action & dance song for children.  Follow along with the actions & dance moves.)
Lyrics:
Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
But first we’ve got to catch them with our hands now
don’t you know.
Put your hands out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we’ll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it’s the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should catch some and take them for a ride
But first we’ve got to catch them with our nose now
don’t you know.
Put your nose out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we’ll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it’s the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
But first we’ve got to catch them with our lips now
don’t you know.
Put your lips out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we’ll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes. 
Slip sliding, it’s the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
First we’ve got to catch them with our tongue now
don’t you know.
Put your tongue out quick and hope they stick.
Then we’ll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it’s the winter thing to do.
It’s the winter thing to do.
It’s the winter thing to do.

Kids! Today's finger family is going to come floating by, so look up in the sky as you wait to greet them. The balloon finger family needs to be careful on their way to meet you children. They need to stay away from birds that can pop them. For that they're signing the family finger song, so they can warn the birds from a distance. Once the balloons get here, you babies can tie their strings onto your finger and do the finger play. How about that? Yay!

Snakes are reptiles that can be found all over the world (except for Antarctica, which is too cold). Some snakes even live in the ocean! Although many people are frightened by snakes, most snakes are not dangerous to humans and they have remarkable abilities such as unhinging their jaw to swallow food whole and smelling with their tongue. Snakes are cool!

The Moon and the Earth

Hello friends, welcome to a new video from Happy Learning. Today we are going to learn about… the Moon.

The Moon is the only satellite that rotates around our planet and it takes 28 days to completely go around the Earth. But, do we now what a satellite is? A natural satellite is any kind of celestial body that rotates, or actually, orbits around a planet.

The Moon is never still, it moves and in two ways. It has a movement of rotation, which means it turns in its own axis, and a movement of translation, that is to say, it rotates around the Earth. 
The duration of the movement of rotation and translation is 28 days. Because it takes the same amount to rotate on its own axis and to completely go around the Earth, the Moon always shows us the same face.

When we observe the Moon along a period of time it appears to change shape. These changes in appearance are called lunar phases and they repeat every 28 days. There are four: full Moon, first quarter, new Moon and last quarter. The Moon phases are produced by two reasons: the movement of the Moon around the Earth and because the Moon reflects light form the sun as a mirror.

New Moon
In this phase the Moon is passing between the Earth and the Sun. The illuminated face of the Moon is facing the opposite direction to Earth. The dark side ends up facing the Earth, and this is why we cannot see the Moon.

First Quarter
You can see it approximately one week after the new Moon.  One half of the illuminated side faces the Earth. It is called the first quarter because, from the new Moon phase, the zone illuminated by the sun grows every time.

Full Moon
Approximately a week after the first quarter, we can see the whole Moon illuminated. The Earth is between the Moon and the sun and we can see it fully.

Last Quarter
The Moon presents its other half face illuminated. The name of the last quarter comes from the fact that the illuminated side becomes smaller and smaller each time

A very easy trick to now whether the Moon is in its first or last quarter is the following. If the Moon has the shape of a C, it is in its last quarter and if it has the shape of a D, it is in its first quarter.

So now you know, the Moon has 4 phases:
New Moon, first quarter, full Moon and last quarter.

Know we are going to learn a few facts about the Moon

Do you know the distance between the Moon and the Earth? Although it looks as though it is not very far away, the Moon is about 385,000 kilometers from the Earth.

Another very interesting fact is that a rocket takes three days to get to the Moon. Its incredible, isn’t it?

The first astronaut that stepped on the Moon was Neil Armstrong and this very important accomplishment occurred in the year 1969 aboard the Apollo 11 rocket.

The Moon is 4 times smaller than the Earth, but it is very important for the sustainability of life in our planet. The Moon generates tides; Do you now what that is? A tide is the rise and fall of the sea level. They occur every 6 hours approximately.

Well now you know a little bit more about the Moon, very interesting, right?

Maple Leaf Learning Playhouse is an educational channel for kids to learn with simple crafts, coloring sheets, songs, toys and games for children! Great for toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarten children.

All of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don’t realize that they’re learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom. 

Our unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you’re sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.",\'Learning Videos for Kids\',true

This is a fun and informative video that teaches children and kids about chickens.  Chickens are farm yard animals that children can easily recognize.   Chickens lay eggs which kids already know about.  They make the familiar ""cluck, cluck"" sound that toddlers and young kids like to say when mimicking animal sounds.
Thanks for watching and learning about Chickens!

Thanks for helping us continue to create quality educational videos for kids around the world!

Your kids will love learning their colors with this fun educational video featuring colorful dump trucks transporting loads of fruits and vegetables.  We'll identify the colors of the fruits and vegetables and also find some stray toys mixed in with the cargo after it's delivered to the depot across town.

I hope this fun visual presentation helps your little ones to learn their colors and how to apply them to everyday objects.

I needed to re-publish this video since it lost all of its ranking and views after YouTube mistakenly demonetized it back in November 2017.  Hopefully my viewers will be able to find it and enjoy it once again.

My goal with this channel is to jump-start your child’s education so they can grow up to be more confident and successful in school, and in life. Recent studies have shown that learning between birth and 3 years old is crucial to your child’s cognitive and emotional development, so let’s make the most of their screen time by giving them the head start they deserve!

If you or your children enjoyed this video, please let me know in the comments below.  And if you have a request for any special type of vehicle or topic that your kids would love to see, drop me a line and maybe I'll be able to incorporate it in an upcoming video!

They can be up to 600 miles across, and make a spiraling shape.
Hurricanes are formed over water in tropical areas, and use warm water as energy. They can move 10-20 miles across the ocean.
Most hurricanes happen over water and they aren’t dangerous to us, but when a hurricane gets close to land, they can cause a lot of damage. Their winds can be up to 200 miles per hour, and they can knock over trees, powerlines, and buildings. They can also cause tornadoes, thunder and lightning, big waves, and flooding.
The hole in the center of a hurricane is called the Eye. It’s a clear part of the storm—no clouds or rain at all. But the area closest to the Eye, the Eye Wall, has the fastest and most dangerous rain and wind.

☆ IT’S OK TO MAKE MISTAKES – Dropping the ball ☆

Everybody makes mistakes, it’s an important part of learning. In this video, Pevan & Sarah go to the park on a sunny day to enjoy a game of catch. Sarah doesn’t know how to catch a ball and even though she tries several times, she keeps dropping it. She gets very angry and upset about the mistake she has made. She cries, she stomps her feet and has a major tantrum. Pevan explains to her that everybody makes mistakes but it’s not the end of the world. So instead of getting upset, she should think about what she has learnt from her mistake. Sarah comes to the conclusion that dropping the ball isn’t a catastrophe after all and she learns a valuable lesson from her mistake.

Your kids will love learning their colors with this fun educational video featuring colorful dump trucks transporting loads of toys from the toy factory to the toy stores across town.  We'll identify the colors of the toys and also find the mixed up toy with the wrong color.

In this video, we'll learn about the colours pink, white, gray, black, cyan (or teal or turquoise) and brown.  We'll also review all of the colours we learned in part one: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.

I hope this fun visual presentation helps your little ones to learn their colors and how to apply them to everyday objects.

If your children are enjoying our videos or if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear from you in the comments below.

Namaste India! In this story about countries, the trio of Neena, Appu and Tiger take a whirlwind tour! Neena wishes to go to a country where she can taste a lot of sweets. Tiger places his paw on a diamond-shaped country, India. They visited the country on the day of Durgashtami. It is one of the most famous festivals in Kolkata, where Goddess Durga is worshipped. They have Gulab Jamuns, a deep-fried sweet, and love it. They visit Kanchenjunga, the third tallest mountain in the world. It is covered with snow all around and a couple of trekkers give them warm clothes. 

The trio learn about the Taj Mahal. They find that the monument is made of the finest marble before visiting the churches and beaches in Goa. They get to know the amazing culture in the country and are awestruck. They visit the Periyar reserve in the southern part of the country and learn the national animal and bird of the country.

This Alphabet song in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the vowel a.  

Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they’ll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.
This letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.
All of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.
Your children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.

Listening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  
The very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.
And, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.  


Lyrics:

 Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet 
 26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet
    
Let’s learn about the letter A
 A is a letter, a is a letter, a is a letter

A is a letter
A is a letter
A is a letter
A is a letter in the alphabet
This is an uppercase A
 Write it in the air like this
This is an uppercase A
Write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase a
Write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase a
Write it in the air like this

Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet

Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
I say the short sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the short sound /a/  /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/

At the beginning of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was an alligator, alligator, alligator
On an adventure, adventure, adventure
To pick some apples, apples, apples
To make some applesauce, applesauce, applesauce

In the middle of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was a rat, rat, rat
And his friend the cat, cat, cat
They loved to rap, rap, rap
In their cool caps, caps, caps

I say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
At the beginning of these words, listen for the long sound /a/
In April, April, April
I met an ape, ape, ape
Who wore an apron, apron, apron
To eat some acorns, acorns, acorns

In the middle of these words
Listen for the long sound /a/
There was a snake, snake, snake
Down by the lake, lake, lake
Who baked a cake, cake, cake
In a silly shape, shape, shape


It’s fun to learn about the alphabet
And I’m really gonna’ try and do my best
Learn each letter, learn each sound
Learn how to write each letter down
I feel so good deep inside
Right now I’m learning how to read and write

Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet 
 26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet

It is a full video game called Mage Math that helps kids build confidence in math while having tons of fun.  

This video introduces picture graphs to students. They will learn how to make their own picture graph as they follow along. Picture graphs are used to help children organize data. This concept can be hard at first but once the kid understand about picture graphs they will be able to organize data and answer key questions with the data.

This video is also great for flipped classrooms as well.

Lyrics:
We are your lungs 
We love to keep your body going 
We provide the oxygen
to fuel your cells so they keep flowing
We’re your lungs
Part of the respiratory system
You can find us in your chest 
Keeping us healthy is your mission

It starts in your mouth 
and in your nasal cavity
When you take in a breath of air
It fills your trachea you see

Your Trachea’s there 
to move the air that you breathe
into the Bronchus in your lungs
They look just like little tree's

Small branches called Bronchioles 
they guide air through me
Which pulls it to these little sacks 
And they’re called Alveoli 

We are your lungs 
we love to keep your body going 
We provide the oxygen
to fuel your cells so they keep flowing
We’re your lungs
Part of the respiratory system
You can find us in your chest 
Keeping us healthy is your mission

The Alveoli’s job
is to take oxygen from the air
and pass it through the walls of Capillary’s 
to blood cells in there

They also take 
carbon dioxide off of your blood cells
which travels through your 
respiratory system
So you can feel well

The Right Lung has an 
Upper, Middle, and a lower Lobe
The left lung
only has the upper and the lower
lobe you know

We are your lungs 
we love to keep your body going 
We provide the oxygen
to fuel your cells so they keep flowing
We’re your lungs
Part of the respiratory system
You can find us in your chest 
Keeping us healthy is your mission
