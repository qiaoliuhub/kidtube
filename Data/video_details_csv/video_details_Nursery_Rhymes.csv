With vinegar and rouh paper.

The Little Boat song lyrics
----------------------------------------------------------

There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
It loved to sail, it loved to sail
It loved to sail around the bay

But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
It couldn't sail, it couldn't sail
It couldn't sail around the bay

And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
We'll swing around, we'll swing around
We'll swing around back to the bay

Thanks for watching our Little Boat nursery rhyme - boat song for kids!

Little Tommy Stout.
What a naughty boy was that,
To try to drown poor pussy cat,
Who ne√≠er did him any harm,
But ate all of the mice in the farmer's barn.

Six little ducks that I once knew
Fat ones, skinny ones, fair ones too
But the one little duck
With the feather on his back
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack
Quack, quack, quack
Quack, quack, quack
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack

Down to the river
They would go, 
Wibble-wobble, wibble-wobble
To and fro
But the one little duck
With the feather on his back 
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack
Quack, quack, quack
Quack, quack, quack
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack

Back from the river They would come,
Wibble-wobble, wibble-wobble
Ho hum hum
But the one little duck
With the feather on his back 
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack

Lyrics:

Chocolate! Yummy chocolate!
It's so super sweet!
Chocolate! mmmm! chocolate!
My favourite treat to eat!

Look at this chocolate bar
I'll break it into two
We can share together
Choc for me and you!

Oh it tastes so good
Sweet like nothing else
Don't hold it too long
Eat before it melts!

Chocolate! Yummy chocolate!
It's so super sweet!
Chocolate! mmmm! chocolate!
My favourite treat to eat!

Now we've finished eating
Chocolate covers our face (haha!)
We lick our lips a little
To have one last taste (haha!)

Chocolate! Yummy chocolate!
It's so super sweet!
Chocolate! mmmm! chocolate!
My favourite treat to eat!

Lyrics:

I heard my mom mentioning about a new baby
Did I hear that correct? Yes. No. Or maybe?!
I hope it's true! A brother or sister would be cool!
I'd play with them every single day after school

A new baby! I wonder if it's a boy or girl?!
A new baby (mmm) would really change my world!

I'd probably have to share some of my toys
Put up with the crying and lots of noise!
I'd help to bath the baby with mom
Having a new baby will be so much fun!

A new baby! I wonder if it's a boy or girl?!
A new baby (mmm) would really change my world!

So the day has arrived and mom went to hospital
My little brother was born and then wrapped in a shawl
He looks a lot like me! And has 10 fingers and toes
I'm so happy! So excited to welcome him home!

A new baby! I now know it's a little boy!
A new baby (mmm) is better than my favorite toy!

YEAH!

Here are the Lyrics:
Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop 
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock 

When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall 
but daddy will catch it and baby wont fall

Baby is drowsing, cozy and fair 
Mother sits near, in her rocking chair 

Forward and back, the cradle she swings 
And though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings

From the high rooftops, down to the sea 
No one's as dear, as baby to me 

Wee little fingers, eyes wide and bright 
Now sound asleep, until morning light.

Small kids can learn a lot from watching nursery rhymes animations with educational video and music. It helps them learn through watching cartoon animals and interesting characters.

The lyrics to ""Five Little Monkeys"":

Five little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head.
Mama called the Doctor and the Doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"".

Four little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped her head.
Papa called the Doctor and the Doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"".

Three little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head.
Mama called the Doctor and the Doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"".

Two little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped her head.
Papa called the Doctor and the Doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"".

One little monkey jumping on the bed,
He fell off and bumped his head.
Mama called the Doctor and the Doctor said,
""Put those monkeys straight to bed!""

Animated by Neil Whitman
Composed by Mike Moran and Alan Watson
Performed by Lucy Cattell

Singalong with the lyrics:

There was an old lady who swallowed a fly
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!
There was an old lady who swallowed a spider,
That wriggled and wiggled and tiggled inside her;
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! 
There was an old lady who swallowed a bird;
How absurd to swallow a bird.
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;
Fancy that to swallow a cat!
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
There was an old lady that swallowed a dog;
What a hog, to swallow a dog;
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
There was an old lady who swallowed a cow,
I don't know how she swallowed a cow;
She swallowed the cow to catch the dog,
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
There was an old lady who swallowed a horse,
She's dead of course!

LYRICS:

Let‚Äôs go for a bike ride!
Get your helmet!
Let‚Äôs go!

I like to ride my bicycle.
I ride it every day.
I ride it when I go to school.
Or when I want to play.

I pedal all around the town.
I pedal round and round and round.
I pedal uphill and don‚Äôt you know.
I can even pedal fast. I can even pedal slow.

I like to ride my bicycle.
I ride it everywhere.
Anywhere you need to go,
A bike can take you there.

I pedal up, I pedal down.
I pedal round and round and round.
And I always stop to say hello.
But if I‚Äôm late for dinner I can go go go!
I can go go go!

I like to ride my bicycle
(whistling)
I like to ride my bicycle
(whistling)

Pedal breakdown:
Half-time pedals - 8x
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go faster!‚Äù
Fast pedals 4x4
‚ÄúWoah not too fast‚Äù - 8 bars
Big uphill half-time pedals - 8x
‚ÄúWe made it! Let‚Äôs go down!‚Äù
Fast downhill pedals - 4x4
‚ÄúWoah not too fast‚Äù - 4 bars

Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.

Let‚Äôs go faster.

Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, whoa!

Not too fast! Look up ahead. It‚Äôs a big hill! 
Come on! Let‚Äôs pedal to the top together!

Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.

We made it! Let‚Äôs go down.

Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, whoa!

Not too fast!

I like to ride my bicycle.
It‚Äôs easy as can be.
I like to ride my bicycle.
And you can ride with me!",\'Nursery Rhymes\',true

Bounce Patrol make original songs and nursery rhymes for the whole family to enjoy. We love getting kids up and bouncing to our music (hence the name - Bounce Patrol!). Jump up and dance along with Jackson, Alyssa, Rachel, Will and Jacinta - let's bounce!

LYRICS:

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Jacinta wants to play, rain rain go away
When it rains we grab our crayons and spread the paper out
Draw a picture of us playing when the sun comes back out 

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Alyssa wants to play, rain rain go away
When it rains we build a cubby house from blankets and the couch
Sit by the window and look outside at the rain pouring down

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Jackson wants to play, rain rain go away
When it rains we pretend to be pirates out at sea
Our ship is in a storm, but we‚Äôre all safe and warm, inside is where we be! Aaarrr

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Rachel wants to play, rain rain go away
When it rains we have a party with all our toys as guests
Set them up and serve them cups of tea, these little cakes are the best!

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Will wants to play, rain rain go away
When it rains we splash in the puddles on the ground
We put on gumboots and a raincoat to keep the raindrops out

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
We all want to play, rain rain go away
Come on everybody!

Rain rain go away, come again another day 
Bounce Patrol wants to play, rain rain go away
Rain rain go away, come again another day

LYRICS:

The Gingerbread Man

Once upon a time there was a Gingerbread 
Man and his story goes like this;
One day a little old man and a little old lady made a Gingerbread Man together.
Soon they opened the oven door
Pop!  Out ran the Gingerbread Man
And the little old lady said, ‚ÄúGingerbread Man, stop, you look so good, we want to eat you up!‚Äù
Chorus:  Run, run as fast as you can
 You can‚Äôt catch me
 I‚Äôm the Gingerbread Man 
(Repeat Chorus)
Soon the Gingerbread Man was skipping through the woods,
Skip, skip, skip to my Lou
Skip, skip, skip to my Lou
And he met a cow
And the cow went, ‚ÄúGingerbread Man, stop, you look so good,
 I want to eat you up!‚Äù
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
Farther down the country road, the Gingerbread Man was hopping along
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop
Hop, hop, hop
And he met a horse
And the horse went, ‚ÄúGingerbread Man, stop, you look so good, I want to eat you up!‚Äù
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
At last the Gingerbread Man met a fox,
A sly, old fox, grinning and licking his lips
And the fox said; ‚ÄúHey little gingerbread dude, stop, I want to talk you.‚Äù
The Gingerbread Man kept running and the fox chased after him
 ‚ÄúOh no, a river‚Äù
The Gingerbread Man didn‚Äôt know what to do
‚ÄúHey, little dude, I‚Äôll help you, just jump on my tail.  I‚Äôll take you across the river, no problemo.‚Äù
Swim, swim, swim,
 I love to swim
‚ÄúBut dude, for the most awesome ride jump on my nose.  That‚Äôs it, Gingerbread Man.  That‚Äôs just right!‚Äù
That sly, old fox got to the other side of the river and tossed the little Gingerbread Man in the air
Snip, snap!
(Repeat Chorus 2x)

Tractor song lyrics
----------------------------------------------------

See the tractor on the farm
In the city, in the sun!
It is helping everyone
Tra la la la la

It can take away the hay
It can plough and it can spray
Working in the fields all day
Waiting for the holiday

See the tractor, it's so strong
It keeps going all along
Driving while we sing this song
Tra la la la la

It can take away the hay
It can plough and it can spray
Working in the fields all day
Waiting for the holiday

See the tractor, there it blows
Smoke is rising from its nose
Engine roars and there it goes
Waiting for the holiday

Thanks for watching the educational song for kids ""The Tractor"" !

Oh no!

Haha! this is too funny!

Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock
The clock... was broken
There was no chime or tick tock

Ok, how about this...

Baa baa black sheep
have you any wool?
No sir, sorry, I sold it all before!

Oh dear! let's try again!

Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Except you won't get anywhere
You're stuck here you see!

Oh dear every nursery rhyme is wrong!

Lyrics:

The wheels on the bus go round and round,
Round and round, round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
All through the town.

The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish,
Swish swish swish, swish swish swish.
The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish,
All through the town.

The doors on the bus go open and shut,
Open and shut, open and shut.
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
All through the town.

The driver on the bus goes, ""Move on back!""
""Move on back! Move on back!""
The driver on the bus goes, ""Move on back!""
All through the town.

The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep,
Beep beep beep, beep beep beep.
The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep,
All through the town.

The babies on the bus go wah wah wah,
Wah wah wah, wah wah wah.
The babies on the bus go wah wah wah,
All through the town.

The mommy on the bus goes shh shh shh,
Shh shh shh, shh shh shh.
The mommy on the bus goes shh shh shh,
All through the town.

The wheels on the bus go round and round,
Round and round, round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
All through the town.",\'Nursery Rhymes\',true

Lyrics: Five Little Ducks
-----------------------------------------------------

Five little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack‚Äù
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack‚Äù
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack‚Äù
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack‚Äù
But only one little duck came back

One little duck went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack‚Äù
But none of the five came back

No little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hills and far away
Daddy duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack‚Äù
And all the five came back

This song expresses the love and affection between Mary and her cute friend, the Little Lamb.

""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" Lyrics:

Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.

Everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
It followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
Laugh and play, laugh and play,
It made the children laugh and play
To see the lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
Turned it out, turned it out,
And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near.

""Why does the lamb love Mary so?""
Love Mary so? Love Mary so?
""Why does the lamb love Mary so?""
The eager children cry.

""Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know.""
the lamb, you know, the lamb, you know
""Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know.""
The teacher did reply.

Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.

Everybody in...it's time to get up and moving with The Pinocchio! 

*** A note about LEFT &amp; RIGHT. We create kids song and nursery rhyme videos for teachers and parents to share primarily with very young learners (Pre-K and younger.)  Those young learners, when dancing along with the video will almost always mirror the actions in the video. So you'll notice that, like an aerobics teacher leading a class, the characters in the video mirror their actions so it's easy to dance along with.

Ice cream, ice cream, I love chocolate!
Ice cream, ice cream, Vanilla! Strawberry!
Cookies and cream!

Ice cream, ice cream, blueberries too.
Ice cream, ice cream, nuts and cherries.
So many toppings!

Ice cream, ice cream, want more flavors?
Ice cream, ice cream, how about caramel
Ice cream, ice cream, Mango! Mint chip!

Down By The Bay lyrics
-----------------------------------------------------
Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a bear, combing his hair?
Down by the bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a moose kissing a goose?
Down by the bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a dog eating a log?
Down by the bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a goat wearing a coat?
Down by the bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a mouse, painting a house?
Down by the bay

***Lyrics***

Five little ducks went out one day 
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only one little duck came back

One little duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But none of the five little ducks came back

Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of five little ducks came back

Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of the five little ducks came back

How many ducks?
1 2 3 4 5 Yay!

Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack""
And all of the five little ducks came back",\'Nursery Rhymes\',true

Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

See the little bunnies sleeping ‚Äòtil it‚Äôs nearly noon
Come and let us gently wake them with a merry tune
They‚Äôre so still. Are they ill?
Wake up, soon

Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!
Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!
Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!
Hop, little bunnies, hop, and stop!

See the little bunnies sleeping ‚Äòtil it‚Äôs nearly noon
Come and let us gently wake them with a merry tune
They‚Äôre so still. Are they ill?
Wake up, soon

Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!
Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!
Hop, little bunnies, hop, hop, hop!

But only four little ducks came back.

But none of the five little ducks came back.

Sad mother duck
Went out one day
Over the hill and far away
The sad mother duck said
""Quack, quack, quack.""
And all of the five little ducks came back.

Wash your hands lyrics - The Bath song by HeyKids
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Wash your hands
Wash your hands
Every single day
Wash your hands
Wash your hands
Wash the dirt away
Now the hands are squeaky clean
But there‚Äôs no towel to be seen
But we can always shake‚Äôem
Shake‚Äôem, shake‚Äôem, shake‚Äôem
We can always shake‚Äôem
Shake‚Äôem till they‚Äôre dry

And now the hair‚Ä¶

Wash your hair
Wash your hair
Every single day
Wash your hair
Wash your hair
Wash the dirt away
Now the hair is squeaky clean
But there‚Äôs no towel to be seen
What can we do?
We can always shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
We can always shake it
Shake it till it‚Äôs dry

And  the feet‚Ä¶

Wash your feet
Wash your feet
Every single day
Wash your feet
Wash your feet
Wash the dirt away
Now the feet are squeaky clean
But there‚Äôs no towel to be seen
And now?
But we can always shake‚Äôem
Shake‚Äôem, shake‚Äôem, shake‚Äôem
We can always shake‚Äôem
Shake‚Äôem till they‚Äôre dry

What about the bum-bum

Wash your bum-bum
Wash your bum-bum
Every single day
Wash your bum-bum
Wash your bum-bum
Wash the dirt away
Now the bum-bum‚Äôs squeaky clean
But there‚Äôs no towel to be seen
But we can always shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
We can always shake it
Shake it till it‚Äôs dry

Thanks for watching ""Wash your hands"", the bath song for kids!

A good listener becomes the best speaker. Music attracts every living being and education through music is really a good idea. Phonics is the basic sound structure of the alphabet where each letter or  group of letters are given a sound. It helps children to sound out unfamiliar words on their own and improves their reading skills. The focus of teaching early years phonics is on developing children's listening skills. They will be encouraged to mimic and memorize musical and natural sounds, which form the basis of common words, improving pupils' ability to take part separate letters and turn them into whole words. Eg: understanding that cuh-ah-tuh = cat. 
Phonics is essential for children to become successful readers, spellers and writers in the early years of schooling. That is why the official school curriculum says that children need to be taught to read using a systematic phonic system. In pre-school or nursery, even before they start learning letter names and sounds, children begin developing their listening skills so that they are tuned into the different sounds in words. The Department of Education states that deploying a phonics education at an early age can also help children develop children culturally, socially and emotionally.
Research shows that phonics when taught correctly is one of the most effective ways of teaching children to learn and read , and can lay a proper foundation for the success of a child .
Reading exercises the brain : Phonics allows children to see letters and provides them with the tools to understand it properly. Beyond reading and writing, it helps children to develop general thinking skills.
Children who practice reading often through phonics, get better."" Practice makes perfect"". It is an important tool for children to develop reading fluency. Children are able to develop into fluent readers. They quickly recognize familiar words and easily sound out new words.
 Sound to symbol recognition becomes faster: A child who learns reading through phonics will have excellent ability to hear, identify, and manipulate letter symbols with their appropriate sound.
Reading builds a child's patience and concentration:  When a child practices reading, they are required to sit still and quietly to focus on reading.  They become better students by following a teacher's instruction over time.
Reading improves grasp of vocabulary and language: Extensive reading helps children broaden their vocabulary and general knowledge. Phonics allows young readers to develop their reading comprehension and decode new as they read. With practice, this action becomes so automatic that they are able to understand the overall meaning of words while they are reading.
Phonics education helps children be imaginative and empathetic: As children develop their reading skills and learn about people, places and events ,outside of their own experience, they begin to imagine how they would feel in that situation. They see the world with new eyes and can better visualize the descriptions of what they read.
Sounding out unfamiliar words is easier: Teaching phonics allows students to find the regular patterns of words, and connect them for easier reading. Unfamiliar words are easier for children to read and understand.
Children learn syllable structure: A  closed syllable will end in a consonant and have a short vowel, while an open syllable will end in a vowel that makes a long sound. English structures become clearer and easier to understand through phonics education.
Higher reading skills result in better success in school: Through phonics education, children become more active with their reading, which also promotes achievement in other subjects. Children can better grasp other types of knowledge across their curriculum.
The learning experience is fun! : Teaching phonics is often designed to be fun and engaging for children. Games and the visuals are often tied to lessons. This approach is meant to enhance the learning experience, and ultimately results in better overall development of reading and writing skills. All children are individuals, each with their own learning styles. Phonics education is one method that can be incorporated into a complete, well-rounded reading program that encourages visual learners to recognize whole words by sight, and creates opportunities for extensive reading and creative writing. The Literacy Project (TLP) aims to bridge the literacy gap and foster a life-long love of reading.

Lyrics:
""The mouse runs in the house
The alligator takes the elevator
The shark plays in the park
The octopus drives the school bus

The mouse runs in the house
The elephant eats in the restaurant
The kangaroo visits the zoo
The octopus drives the school bus

The mouse runs in the house
The dolphin jumps on the trampoline
The tiger is the zookeeper
The octopus drives the school bus

The mouse runs in the house
The zebra conducts the orchestra
The raccoon holds a balloon
The octopus drives the school bus

The mouse runs in the house
The alligator takes the elevator
The shark plays in the park
The octopus drives the school bus""

My Bonnie lies over the ocean,
my Bonnie lies over the sea,
My Bonnie lies over the ocean, 
O bring back my Bonnie to me.

Chorus:
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me, to me:
Bring back, bring back, O bring back my Bonnie to me.

O blow ye winds over the ocean, 
O blow ye winds over the sea.
O blow ye winds over the ocean,
And bring back my Bonnie to me.

Repeat chorus

Last night as I lay on my pillow,
Last night as I lay on my bed,
Last night as I lay on my pillow,
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead.

Repeat chorus

The winds have blown over the ocean,
The winds have blown over the sea,
The winds have blown over the ocean,
And brought back my Bonnie to me.

Repeat chorus

My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank,
The height of its contents to see,
I lit a small match to assist her,
O Bring back my Bonnie to me.

Repeat chorus

Last night as I lay on my pillow,
Last night as I lay on my bed,
I stuck my feet out of the window,
In the morning the neighbors were dead.

Repeat chorus

My mother makes beer in the bathtub,
My father makes synthetic gin,
My sister makes fudge for a quarter,
Wouldja believe how the money rolls in?

Repeat chorus

My mother, she drowned in the bathtub,
My father, he died from his gin,
My sister choked on her chocolate,
My stars, what a fix I am in.

Repeat chorus

I tried making beer in the bathtub,
I tried making synthetic gin,
I tried making fudge for a living,
Now look at the shape that I'm in.

Here is one of the rhymes from the video:

‚ÄúThe Swing‚Äù by Robert Lewis Stevenson 

How do you like to go up in a swing,
   Up in the air so blue?
Oh, I do think it is the pleasantest thing
   Ever a child can do!

Up in the air and over the wall,
   Till I can see so wide,
River and trees and cattle and all
   Over the countryside--

Till I look down on the garden green
   Down on the roof so brown--
Up in the air I go flying again,
   Up in the air and down!",\'Nursery Rhymes\',true

LYRICS:
Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Life is but a dream

Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
If you see a waterfall
Don't forget to scream

Row row row your boat
Quickly up the stream
Row away from waterfalls
And hope they're just a dream

Row row row your boat
Gently up the stream
If you see a crocodile
Don't forget to scream

Row row row your boat
Zoom back down the stream
Right over the waterfall
Onto the trampoline

Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Life is but a dream

All Shirley wants is to gather her three adult children around her and share the news as a family. But Tammy, Kimberly and Byron are too distracted by their own problems: Tammy can't manage her unruly children or her broken marriage; Kimberly is gripped with anger and takes it out on her husband; and Byron, after spending two years in jail, is under pressure to deal drugs again. It's up to Madea, with the help of the equally rambunctious Aunt Bam, to gather the clan together and make things right the only way she knows how: with a lot of tough love, laughter...and the revelation of a long-buried family secret.",\'Nursery Rhymes\',true

When the bullying prince of a middle European nation tries to kidnap the auto and its inventor, he grabs the wrong guy and the wrong car.

Six marbles rolling down the hill
Let's follow them it will be a thrill
Six birds are watching up above
And can you see six flowers with six bees buzzing?
Six, six what a magical number
See six ants marching on a cucumber
That's six, six dogs chasing a frisbee 
It must be a six number day!

Six marbles rolling down the hill
Let's follow them it will be a thrill
Six birds are watching up above
And can you see six flowers with six bees buzzing?
Six, six what a magical number
See six ants marching on a cucumber
That's six, six dogs chasing a frisbee 
It must be a six number day!

Lyrics:

Oh, Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch pil of water 
Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill went tumbling after

This little piggy went to market, and this little piggy went home and this piggy had roast beef and this had none and this little piggy cried wee wee wee all the way home!

Aha!

Gee, i'd like to go with Mother Goose on a journey, just to visit with the dame who lives in a show

Oh, i know i'd really raise the duece on the journey, seeing old King Cole and even Little Boy Blue

Mabey Mary's lamb and Simple Simon would greet me, the cat with the little play that play something new

There is where i'd like to be

At the airport, at the airport 
The bus soon arrives at the airport

Lyrics:
Lets sing a song about the number one
It's very easy and lots of fun
Lets sing a song about the number one
And here we go...
One fast car so blue and bright
One jet airplane taking flight
One big tugboat on the lake
And one long train, train, train

Lets sing a song about the number one
It's very easy and lots of fun
Lets sing a song about the number one
And here we go...
One juicy orange that tastes so great!
One yellow banana on my plate
One sweet Apple I love to eat
And one ripe strawberry!

SAFETY FIRST! Children: Do not climb up any object without proper adult supervision! Jacus (the boy in the video) is an expert - his climbing should not be copied!

Lyric:
Miss Polly had a dolly
Who was sick, sick, sick
So she called for the doctor
To come quick, quick, quick
The doctor came
With his bag and his hat
And he knocked on the door
With a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly
And he shook his head,
And he said ""Miss Polly,
Put her straight to bed.""
He wrote on the paper
For a pill, pill, pill
""I'll be back in the morning
For the bill, bill, bill.""

Miss Polly had a dolly
Who was sick, sick, sick
So she called for the doctor
To come quick, quick, quick
The doctor came
With his bag and his hat
And he knocked on the door
With a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly
And he shook his head,
And he said ""Miss Polly,
Put her straight to bed.""
He wrote on the paper
For a pill, pill, pill
""I'll be back in the morning
For the bill, bill, bill.""

About the song:

""A Sailor Went to Sea is a children's nursery rhyme, clapping game and jump-rope rhyme. It was initially called 'My Father Went to Sea', before becoming more widely known as A Sailor Went to Sea. It is typically sung to the tune of The Sailor's Hornpipe.""
The song was parodied in an episode of VeggieTales as ""Some Veggies Went To Sea"".
The song appeared in ""Gloriana"", episode 10, season 1 of the Netflix drama The Crown.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sailor_Went_to_Sea) 

Lyrics

A sailor went to sea, sea, sea
To see what he could see, see, see
But all that he could see, see, see
Was the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea

A sailor went to chop, chop, chop
To see what he could chop, chop, chop
But all that he could chop, chop, chop
Was the bottom of the deep blue chop, chop, chop

A sailor went to knee, knee, knee
To see what he could knee, knee, knee
But all that he could knee, knee, knee
Was the bottom of the deep blue knee, knee, knee

A sailor went to toe, toe, toe
To see what he could toe, toe, toe
But all that he could toe, toe, toe
Was the bottom of the deep blue toe, toe, toe

To see what he could Timbuktu

Lyric:
Three little kittens they lost their mittens
and they began to cry
""Oh, mother, dear, we sadly fear
our mittens we have lost""
""What?! Lost your mittens, 
you naughty kittens,
then you shall have no pie""
Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow
We shall have no pie

Three little kittens they lost their mittens
and they began to cry
""Oh, mother, dear, we sadly fear

""What?! Lost your mittens, 
you naughty kittens,
then you shall have no pie""
Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow

Three little kittens they lost their mittens
and they began to cry
""Oh, mother, dear, we sadly fear
our mittens we have lost""
""What?! Lost your mittens, 
you naughty kittens,
then you shall have no pie""
Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow
We shall have no pie

The three little kittens they found their mittens
lying on the road
""Oh, mother, dear, see here, see here,
our mittens we have found!""
""What?! Put on your mittens
you silly kittens and you shall have some pie""
Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow
oh, let us have some pie!

Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle 
The cow jumped over the moon 

Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the griddle
The Bug Jumped on the cheese
The little boy laughed to see such fun
And the rat ran away with the cheese

Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the griddle
