Swim Like A Little Fish lyrics
----------------------------------------------

I'm going to learn to swim like a little fish
I'm going to learn to swim like a little fish
I'm going to learn to swim like a little fish
In the summertime

Mom's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
Mom's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
Mom's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
In the summertime

Daddy's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
Daddy's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
Daddy's gonna teach me to swim like a little fish
In the summertime

Now I can begin to swim like a little fish
Now I can begin to swim like a little fish
Now I can begin to swim like a little fish
In the summertime

I'm gonna jump right in like a little fish
I'm gonna jump right in like a little fish
I'm gonna jump right in like a little fish
In the summertime

I'm gonna flap my fins like a little fish
I'm gonna flap my fins like a little fish
I'm gonna flap my fins like a little fish
In the summertime

I'm gonna learn to swim like a little fish
I'm gonna learn to swim like a little fish
I'm gonna learn to swim like a little fish
In the summertime

The Doctor song lyrics
-------------------------------------
When my nose is runny
A rumble in my tummy
When I got a boo boo
I go boo hoo!

When my throat is scratchy
Or my skin is itchy
When I got a flu flu
I go boo hoo!

I go to the doctor
The doctor is my friend
Whenever I get sick or hurt
He makes me well again

I go to the doctor
And sing this little tune
I know that I'll feel better soon

When I get a bee sting
Or fall from a high swing
When I got a big bruise
I go boo hoo!

When I get a bad cough
Or burned by a teapot
Tell me what do you do?
I go boo hoo!

I go to the doctor
The doctor is my friend
Whenever I get sick or hurt
He makes me well again

I go to the doctor
And sing this little tune
I know that I'll feel better soon

When I get a check up
My toes to my neck up
You know who I turn to
There's no boo hoo!

When there's nothing wrong
Just making sure I'm strong
I sing a little song
I don't go boo hoo!

I go to the doctor
The doctor is my friend
Whenever I get sick or hurt
He makes me well again

I go to the doctor
And sing this little tune
I know that I'll feel better soon
I know I'll feel much better soon

Thanks for watching "" Baby Goes to Doctor"" song for kids!

Oh Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah
Come light the menorah
Let's have a party
We'll all dance the hora
Gather 'round the table
We'll give you a treat, Sevivon to play with, and Latkes to eat

And while we are playing
The candles are burning low
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
To remind us of days long ago
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
To remind us of days long ago.

Lyrics:

One little fishy swimming in the sea. 
Along came another one, and then there were two.

Two little fishies swimming in the sea.
Along came another one, and then there were three.

Three little fishies swimming in the sea. 
Along came another one, and then there were four.

Swimming swimming swimming in the sea.
That big ol‚Äô shark will never catch me. 

Four little fishies swimming in the sea.
Along came another one, and then there were five.

Five little fishies swimming in the sea. 
Along came another one, and then there were six.

Six little fishies swimming in the sea.
Along came another one, and then there were seven

Swimming swimming swimming in the sea.
That big ol‚Äô shark will never catch me. 

Seven little fishies swimming in the sea.
Along came another one, and then there were eight.

Eight little fishies swimming in the sea. 
Along came another one, and then there were nine.

Nine little fishies swimming in the sea.
Along came another one, and then there were ten.

Swimming swimming swimming in the sea.
That big ol‚Äô shark will never catch me. 

Swimming swimming swimming in the sea.
That big ol‚Äô shark will never catch me.

Swimming swimming swimming in the sea.
That big ol‚Äô shark will never catch me 

He‚Äôll never,
Never,
Never,
Never,
That big old shark will never catch me!

""A Sailor Went To Sea"" Lyrics:

A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was the bottom of the deep blue sea sea sea

A seahorse!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea

A jellyfish!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was a jellyfish swimming and a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea

A turtle!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was a turtle swimming, and a jellyfish swimming, and a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea

An octopus!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was an octopus swimming, and a turtle swimming, and a jellyfish swimming, and a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea

A baby shark!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was a baby shark swimming, and an octopus swimming, and a turtle swimming, and a jellyfish swimming, and a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea

A blue whale!
A sailor went to sea sea sea
To see what she could see see see
But all that she could see see see
Was a blue whale swimming, and a baby shark swimming, and an octopus swimming, and a turtle swimming, and a jellyfish swimming, and a seahorse swimming in the sea sea sea.

Tractor song lyrics
----------------------------------------------------

See the tractor on the farm
In the city, in the sun!
It is helping everyone
Tra la la la la

It can take away the hay
It can plough and it can spray
Working in the fields all day
Waiting for the holiday

See the tractor, it's so strong
It keeps going all along
Driving while we sing this song
Tra la la la la

It can take away the hay
It can plough and it can spray
Working in the fields all day
Waiting for the holiday

See the tractor, there it blows
Smoke is rising from its nose
Engine roars and there it goes
Waiting for the holiday

Thanks for watching the educational song for kids ""The Tractor"" !

Cat, hamster and the dog. Lets sing!

This nice and warm animal song is the manifestation of all children‚Äôs dreams.

Each time we want them to do something at home, they start thinking how fascinating life would be if they were pets: cats, dogs or hamsters...they wouldn‚Äôt have to do all the homework or housework‚Ä¶

My children are the same...the song is my answer to their ideas. It‚Äôs a kind of the  other side, which apparently our kids don‚Äôt take into account when dreaming.
If your child tells you that he or she would like to be a cat when you ask him or her to take the rubbish out, you can sing that song as the answer‚Ä¶.



Oh, I‚Äôd like to be a pet
silky, sweety little cat.
I could play with a ball
or sleep all day long
 I‚Äôd like to be a cat.

Or, I‚Äôd like to be a dog
cute and fluffy little dog.
I could bark  very loud
hide and seek with you outside.
Oh, I‚Äôd like to be a dog.

Hamsters‚Äô life is pretty nice
they can ride merry-go-round.
Hamster-that‚Äôs what I should be
how to change, tell me please.
Cause I‚Äôd like to be a pet.

But you couldn‚Äôt ride a bike
or play cards with your mama and dad.
Pets are pretty and they‚Äôre funny
but I love my awesome sonny.
Come and hug and don‚Äôt be sad.",\'kids\' songs\',true

Jingle Bells Lyrics
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight!

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.",\'kids\' songs\',true

The Boo Boo Song - Original Song Lyrics:

Hey boys and girls, I like to say
my name is Jonah and it's time to play
so many toys in my room
look at all these cars, vroom vroom vroom!
imagination is so much fun
I love to dance and I love to run
I love to hop on the bed
(crash sound) Ouch! I hurt my leg!

Chorus:
Mommy, mommy, I tripped and hurt my leg
it's filled with so much pain... I think its turning red
take away this boo boo, it's making me so sad
thanks... I feel so better, once again I'm glad!

It's time to get back to my toys
play all day, I'm a happy boy
I love to ride in my firetruck
sometimes I quack, like I'm a duck
pretend play! One of my favorite things
I think I can fly and my arms are wings
give it a try and hop off my bed
Oh No! I fell and hurt my head

Mommy, mommy, I fell and hurt my head
it's filled with so much pain, I think its turning red
take away this boo boo, it's making me so sad
thanks, I feel so better, once again I'm glad

so many games, not enough time
cars, trucks, all different kinds
of vehicles lined up on the floor
there's no way I could ever be bored
use my imagination in my mind
visit anywhere, anyplace, any time
but I love to jump on my bed
I just hope I dont, hurt my leg

Mommy, mommy, I tripped and hurt my leg
it's filled with so much pain, I think its turning red
take away this boo boo, it's making me so sad
thanks, I feel so better, once again I'm glad....",\'kids\' songs\',true

'WE'RE GOING ON A LION HUNT SONG LYRICS FOR KIDS'
We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Oh, Look at that tall wavy grass
It's so tall

Can't go over it  X2
Can't go under it X2
Just going to have to go through it  X2
swish swish swish 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, there's a big river
Can't go over it X2 
Can't go under it X2 
Going to have to swim it X2
splash splash splash 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Ugh, look at all that mud
so muddy
Can't go over it  X2
Can't go under it X2
Going to have to go through it
squish squish squish  

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, what's that
It's a cave
We can't go over it
We can't go under it
Going to have to go into it
step step step 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared 
I'm a little scared

Sure is dark in here
What's that in the corner
I feel 2  big ears  X 2
I feel 1 wet nose  X 2
I feel 2 sharp teeth  X2 
I know what that is
It's a lion

Let's get out of here

Let's run out of the cave
step step step 

Quickly back through the mud
squish squish squish

Let's cross the river
splash splash splash 

Through the tall grass
swish swish swish


Through the yard, up the stairs, into the house, close the door

We're safe

That's a close one

Let's not go lion hunting anymore!

Five Little Speckled Frogs Lyrics:

Five little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log
Eating some most delicious bugs
Yum Yum
One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Now there are four green speckled frogs
Glub Glub

Four little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log
Eating some most delicious bugs
Yum Yum
One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Now there are three green speckled frogs
Glub Glub

Three little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log
Eating some most delicious bugs
Yum Yum
One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Now there are two green speckled frogs
Glub Glub
 
Two little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log
Eating some most delicious bugs
Yum Yum
One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Now there is one green speckled frog
Glub Glub

One little speckled frog
Sat on a speckled log
Eating some most delicious bugs
Yum Yum
One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Now there are no green speckled frogs
Glub Glub

Lyrics:
The ants go marching one by one.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching one by one.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching one by one.
The little one stops to suck his thumb.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching two by two.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching two by two.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching two by two.
The little one stops to tie his shoe.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching three by three.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching three by three.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching three by three.
The little one stops to climb a tree.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching four by four.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching four by four.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching four by four.
The little one stops to shut the door.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching five by five.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching five by five.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching five by five.
The little one stops to take a dive.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching six by six.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching six by six.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching six by six.
The little one stops to pick up sticks.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching seven by seven.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching seven by seven.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching seven by seven.
The little one stops to pray to heaven.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom!

The ants go marching eight by eight.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching eight by eight.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching eight by eight.
The little one stops to rollerskate.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom! 

The ants go marching nine by nine.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching nine by nine.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching nine by nine.
The little one stops to check the time.
And they all go marching down to the ground.
To get out of the rain.
Boom, boom, boom! 

The ants go marching ten by ten.
Hoorah! Hoorah!
The ants go marching ten by ten.

***Lyrics***

Five little ducks went out one day 
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only one little duck came back

One little duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But none of the five little ducks came back

Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of five little ducks came back

Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of the five little ducks came back

How many ducks?
1 2 3 4 5 Yay!

Over the hill and far away

Lyrics:
Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home
I dare not go.
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a cat wearing a hat?‚Äù
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home
I dare not go.
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a goat rowing a boat?‚Äù
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a frog walking a dog?‚Äù
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home
I dare not go.
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a bear combing his hair?‚Äù
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a llama wearing pajamas?‚Äù
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home
I dare not go.
For if I do
My mother will say,
‚ÄúDid you ever see a dragon pulling a wagon?‚Äù
Down by the bay.
Down by the bay.

Oh we could be pirates, sailing the ocean, we could be all you like

Our animated A Tooty Ta song  is super popular children‚Äôs song and dance. Students get some fun physical activity,while they rejuvenate their body and brain. Children everywhere love Tooty ta! Tooty Ta is a growing pattern, repeat after me song and dance.

Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student‚Äôs attention, giving them a mental and physical break from their academics. This  enables them to have a better focus for learning. 
 Tooty-Ta as a ‚Äúbrain break‚Äù is a win-win situation. Students learn during these ‚Äúbrain breaks‚Äù plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My  Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.
It‚Äôs also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

""This Is The Way"" Lyrics:
This is the way we wash our face,
wash our face, wash our face.
This is the way we wash our face.
Early in the morning.

Wash wash wash
Wash wash wash.

This is the way we comb our hair,
comb our hair, comb our hair.
This is the way we comb our hair.
Early in the morning.

Comb comb comb
Comb comb comb.

This is the way we brush our teeth,
brush our teeth, brush our teeth.
This is the way we brush our teeth.
Early in the morning.

Brush brush brush
Brush brush brush. 

This is the way we get dressed,
get dressed, get dressed.
This is the way we get dressed.
Early in the morning.

This is the way we go to school,
go to school, go to school.
This is the way we go to school.
Early in the morning.

Follow the directions in the song.
Stop and Go songs stimulate the frontal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes allow us to set and achieve goals, and have impulse control and empathy for others. Move and Freeze is an action song for children that helps you achieve!
Lyrics:
Chorus:
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put your right hand on your left knee, 
your left hand on your right.
Your knees move in and out. 
Your hands stay tight.
Now keep on with your moving 
but switch hands on your knees.
Keep on moving in and out till we say freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put one hand across your shoulder 
one hand across your back.
Now jump in place. Do you like it like that?
Now switch hands across your shoulders 
and switch hands across your back.
Now just be nimble, just be quick, just like Jack.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
Everybody shake your body from your head down to your feet.
And don‚Äôt stop shaking until we stop the beat.
Shake it to the east and shake it to the west.
Shake it, shake it, shake it with my friends who are the best.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
Put your right hand on your head, your left on someone‚Äôs knee.
Now turn once in a circle and buzz like a bee.
Now turn the other way, don‚Äôt let go or lose your spot.
Keep turning left, keep turning right until the music stops.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
‚ÄúAlright, you can move now.‚Äù

Lyrics:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause.
Out jumps good old Santa Claus.
Down through the chimney, with lots of toys.
All for the little ones' Christmas joys.

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click.
Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick.

First come the stockings in a row.
Filled with goodies top to toe.
Then to the tree old Santa springs,
To place the presents that he brings.

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click.
Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick.

Everything delivered from his sack.
Santa has a cookie snack.
Back to the reindeer and the sleigh.
Into the night they fly away.

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn‚Äôt go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click.
Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick.

Lyrics:
 
This is the way we put on our t-shirt.
Put on our t-shirt, put on our t-shirt.
This is the way we put on our t-shirt
We get dressed every day

This is the way we put on our pants
Put on our pants, put on our pants
This is the way we put on our pants
We get dressed every day

This is the way we button our shirt
Button our shirt, button our shirt
This is the way we button our shirt
We get dressed every day

This is the way we put on our socks
Put on our socks, put on our socks
This is the way we put on our socks
We get dressed every day


This is the way we tie our shoes
Tie our shoes, tie our shoes
This is the way we tie our shoes
We get dressed every day

This is the way we zip up our jacket
Zip up our jacket, zip up our jacket
This is the way we zip up our jacket
We get dressed every day

Lyrics:
On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree

On the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the sixth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the seventh day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the eighth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids-a-milking
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids-a-milking
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the tenth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Ten lords-a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids-a-milking
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the eleventh of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords-a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids-a-milking
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords-a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids-a-milking
Seven swans-a-swimming
Six geese-a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

Lyrics:
Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only four ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Four little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only three ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3.

Three little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only two ghosts flew.

1, 2. 

Two little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only one ghost flew.

1. 

One little ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house no little ghosts flew. 

Sad mother ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew. 

Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew.

Lyrics:
Six In The Bed
There were six in the bed
and the little one said,
""Roll over, roll over.""
So they all rolled over and one fell out.

Five! 
There were five in the bed
and the little one said,
""Roll over, roll over.""
So they all rolled over and one fell out.

Four! 
There were four in the bed .
And the little one said,
""Roll over, roll over.""
So they all rolled over and one fell out.

Three! 
There were three in the bed 
and the little one said,
""Roll over, roll over.""
So they all rolled over and one fell out.

Two! 
There were two in the bed
and the little one said,
""Roll over, roll over.""
So they both rolled over and one fell out.

One! 
There was one in the bed
and the little one said,
""I'm lonely...[sigh].""

Lyrics:
Three little kittens, they lost their mittens, 
And they began to cry,
‚ÄúOh, mother dear, we sadly fear, 
That we have lost our mittens.‚Äù
‚ÄúLost your mittens, you naughty kittens! 
Then you shall have no pie.
Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Then you shall have no pie.‚Äù

Three little kittens, they found their mittens, 
And they began to cry, 
‚ÄúOh, mother dear, see here, see here, 
For we have found our mittens.‚Äù
‚ÄúPut on your mittens, you silly kittens, 
And you shall have some pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow
Oh, let us have some pie.‚Äù

Three little kittens put on their mittens, 
And soon ate up the pie, 
‚ÄúOh, mother dear, we greatly fear, 
That we have soiled our mittens.‚Äù
‚ÄúSoiled your mittens, you naughty kittens."" 
Then they began to sigh, 
""Meow, meow, meow, meow.‚Äù
Then they began to sigh.

Three little kittens, they washed their mittens, 
And hung them out to dry, 
‚ÄúOh, mother dear, do you not hear, 
That we have washed our mittens?‚Äù
‚ÄúWashed your mittens, then you're good kittens, 
And you shall have some pie.
Meow, meow meow, meow.
And you shall have some pie‚Äù

This Alphabet song in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the vowel a.  

Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they‚Äôll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.
This letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.
All of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.
Your children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.

Listening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  
The very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.
And, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.  


Lyrics:

 Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet 
 26 letters, that‚Äôs it, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet
    
Let‚Äôs learn about the letter A
 A is a letter, a is a letter, a is a letter

A is a letter
A is a letter
A is a letter
A is a letter in the alphabet
This is an uppercase A
 Write it in the air like this
This is an uppercase A
Write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase a
Write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase a
Write it in the air like this

Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet

Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
I say the short sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the short sound /a/  /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/

At the beginning of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was an alligator, alligator, alligator
On an adventure, adventure, adventure
To pick some apples, apples, apples
To make some applesauce, applesauce, applesauce

In the middle of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was a rat, rat, rat
And his friend the cat, cat, cat
They loved to rap, rap, rap
In their cool caps, caps, caps

I say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
At the beginning of these words, listen for the long sound /a/
In April, April, April
I met an ape, ape, ape
Who wore an apron, apron, apron
To eat some acorns, acorns, acorns

In the middle of these words
Listen for the long sound /a/
There was a snake, snake, snake
Down by the lake, lake, lake
Who baked a cake, cake, cake
In a silly shape, shape, shape


It‚Äôs fun to learn about the alphabet
And I‚Äôm really gonna‚Äô try and do my best
Learn each letter, learn each sound
Learn how to write each letter down
I feel so good deep inside
Right now I‚Äôm learning how to read and write

Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet 
 26 letters, that‚Äôs it, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet

We are excited to present our Shape Song, a groovy and interactive song for kids that introduces four 2D shapes: circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. 

In each verse, a shape describes itself and asks the kids to guess what they are. As they introduce themselves, they turn into objects that resemble their shape, to show how they can be found in many different every day objects.

During the chorus, our cute characters ride a bus through a landscape in which they find lots of things made of the shapes they just learned about. The words and melody of the chorus are catchy and easy to sing along. We have also provided the lyrics on the screen for the teachers and parents!

Our Shape Song is great to use for home schooling or in the classroom as a part of a fun preschool activity. The illustrations inspire kids to draw shapes on their own, exploring each shape and their characteristics.

Lyrics:
There are eight planets, eight planets
In our solar system. 
There are eight planets, eight planets.
Can you name all of them? 
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn too.
Don‚Äôt forget Uranus and Neptune. 
They‚Äôre part of the crew.

Mercury is the smallest one,
The closest planet to the sun.
Shiny Venus is number two, 
By far the hottest planet too.
Earth is home to you and me
And living things like whales and trees.
Mars is fourth in line, you know.
It‚Äôs dry and red with volcanoes.

There are eight planets, eight planets
In our solar system. 
There are eight planets, eight planets,
Can you name all of them? 
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn too.
Don‚Äôt forget Uranus and Neptune. 
They‚Äôre part of the crew.

Jupiter has the largest mass,   
A planet made of layers of gas. 
Saturn is famous for many things,
Its moons, its size, its pretty rings.
Uranus means the god of heaven. 
Count its moons, all twenty-seven.
Neptune‚Äôs eighth and way out there,
Farthest from the sun we share.

There are eight planets, eight planets
In our solar system. 
There are eight planets, eight planets.
Can you name all of them? 
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn too.
Don‚Äôt forget Uranus and Neptune. 
They‚Äôre part of the crew.

There are eight planets, eight planets
In our solar system.
There are eight planets, eight planets.
Now we know all of them.

Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel 
From the CD, Seasonal Songs in Motion
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics:
Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel 

(Actions: During the choruses pretend to mold clay by pressing hands together. Spin when appropriate and act out the story such as bouncing, digging and being a tree that grows branches.

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

I made my first dreidel out of some clay.
I painted on symbols then I put it away.
The clay had all hardened and the paint was all dried.
I looked at my dreidel and what a surprise!

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

The dreidel was spinning, spinning all by itself.
I watched in amazement as it spun off the shelf.
It was spinning so fast then that it looked like a top, but there was one problem.
It just wouldn't stop.

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

It spun to the kitchen, then it bounced on the floor. Flew right by my window, then right out the door.
It spun down the stairs then but it didn't go far. It just started digging a big hole in my yard.

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel
we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

The digging was over. Things quieted down. The dreidel had planted itself in the ground.
Through spring and then summer, and then into fall, the dreidel was growing to about ten feet tall.

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

The dreidel grew branches and then grew some more and from all those branches grew dreidels galore.
This story is silly but it never ends for now we have dreidels for all of our friends.

Chorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.

""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Song Lyrics"":

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
you would even say it glows. 


All of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"" 

Then all the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, 
you'll go down in history!

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Mercury
I‚Äôm the second hottest planet
The closest one to the sun
A year on my surface is 88 days
I‚Äôm the smallest but I‚Äôm lots of fun

My name is Venus
I‚Äôm the hottest planet 
But the second planet from the sun
I‚Äôm the brightest planet in our solar system
And I‚Äôm too hot for anyone

My name is Earth
I‚Äôm the planet you live on 
The Third Planet from the sun
I‚Äôm the only planet with organic life
So take care of me because we‚Äôre all one

My name is mars
I am red in color 
The fourth planet from the sun
I have the highest mountain in our solar system
A volcano named Olympus Mons

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Jupiter I am covered in clouds
I‚Äôm the fifth planet from the sun
My giant red spot is a raging storm 
As for size, I‚Äôm the biggest one

My name is Saturn I am brown in color
I‚Äôm the sixth planet from the sun 
My outer rings are extremely thin
They‚Äôre made of dust and icy chunks 

My names Uranus I am blue in color 
I‚Äôm the seventh planet from the sun
Humans have named me the icy planet 
Because I am the coldest one

My name is Neptune I am blue in color 
I‚Äôm the eighth planet from the sun
I have too many storms in my atmosphere 
And I‚Äôm the furthest planet from the sun 

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer song | Nashville carol | Christmas poem for kids 2020 | Shoury Vasishta



Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history""",\'kids\' songs\',true

Lyrics:
Put on your shoes, your shoes, your shoes. 
Put on your shoes, your shoes, your shoes.
Put on your shoes.
Let's go outside. 
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry hurry up! 

Put on your jacket, your jacket, your jacket.
Put on your jacket, your jacket, your jacket.
Put on your jacket.
Let's go outside.
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry hurry up!

Put on your scarf, your scarf, your scarf.
Put on your scarf, your scarf, your scarf.
Put on your scarf.
Let's go outside.
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry hurry up!

Put on your hat, your hat, your hat.
Put on your hat, your hat, your hat.
Put on your hat.
Let's go outside.
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry hurry up!

Put on your shoes.
Your jacket.
Your scarf.
And your hat.
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry hurry up!

About the song:

""A Sailor Went to Sea is a children's nursery rhyme, clapping game and jump-rope rhyme. It was initially called 'My Father Went to Sea', before becoming more widely known as A Sailor Went to Sea. It is typically sung to the tune of The Sailor's Hornpipe.""
The song was parodied in an episode of VeggieTales as ""Some Veggies Went To Sea"".
The song appeared in ""Gloriana"", episode 10, season 1 of the Netflix drama The Crown.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sailor_Went_to_Sea) 

Lyrics

A sailor went to sea, sea, sea
To see what he could see, see, see
But all that he could see, see, see
Was the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea

A sailor went to chop, chop, chop
To see what he could chop, chop, chop
But all that he could chop, chop, chop
Was the bottom of the deep blue chop, chop, chop

A sailor went to knee, knee, knee
To see what he could knee, knee, knee
But all that he could knee, knee, knee
Was the bottom of the deep blue knee, knee, knee

A sailor went to toe, toe, toe
To see what he could toe, toe, toe
But all that he could toe, toe, toe
Was the bottom of the deep blue toe, toe, toe

A sailor went to Timbuktu,
To see what he could Timbuktu
But all that he could Timbuktu
Was the bottom of the deep blue Timbuktu",\'kids\' songs\',true

Colors of Spanish has been providing Spanish language programs for toddlers, children of all ages, and adults in Northern California since 2004. Guadalupe Tausch, who leads the Colors of Spanish team, was born and raised in Mexico and has a Master's Degree in Spanish. Through language education, music, stories, and cultural exchange we work to unite Spanish-speaking and English-speaking communities. Studies show there are tremendous benefits to learning a second language. Music is a fantastic way for children to learn Spanish as it stimulates memory, improves pronunciation, and it's fun!...so kids are more likely to want to repeat lyrics over and over which is a key element to learning and retaining a second language. Thank you for joining us!!

Colors of Spanish provee espa√±ol a ni√±os de edad temprana en el norte de California desde el 2004. Guadalupe Tausch, fundadora y l√≠der del equipo, naci√≥ y creci√≥ en M√©xico. Obtuvo su licenciatura de negocios en su pa√≠s y m√°s tarde en California una maestr√≠a en espa√±ol con √©nfasis en adquisici√≥n de espa√±ol como segunda lengua desde la edad temprana. A trav√©s de la educaci√≥n del lenguaje e incorporando un curr√≠culo √∫nico a prescolares, bibliotecas, museos, escuelas, docentes, familias biling√ºes o multiling√ºes, el equipo de COS funge como un puente entre la comunidad de habla hispana y la comunidad de habla inglesa. 

Estudios demuestran que hay un tremendo beneficio de aprender un segundo idioma en la edad temprana a trav√©s del juego, cuentos, m√∫sica y movimiento entre otros. Estos componentes en combinaci√≥n; tienen una forma fant√°stica de estimular la memoria, mejorar la pronunciaci√≥n, mover el cuerpo, repetir liricas, conectar vocabulario con acciones, aprender el idioma en contexto, estimular la audici√≥n y el lenguaje, motivar, identificar secuencias y reconocer diversidad de culturas. Y esto solo por mencionar algunas de las herramientas necesarias para aprender, asimilar, conectar, familiarizar y retener un segundo idioma; adem√°s de ser divertido!",\'kids\' songs\',true

What are phonics songs? What are / is phonics? Basically, phonics, phonetics, phonemic awareness or phonology are all concerned with the way we pronounce, articulate, enunciate, and recognize the written ABC's in speech. i.e. How the written letters and spelling patterns (graphemes) sound when we speak and hear them (phonemes).

The Goldfish by Laurie Berkner

C....................................Am
Lots of little fish were sleeping
........................F..........G.........C
on a rock in the bottom of the ocean. 
They lifted up their heads
..................Am
 and they shook out their tails
................F...G...........C
 and they said let's go swimming. 

Chorus 
Let's go swimming. Let's go swimming 
G7................C
Yeah let's go swimming. Let's go swimming 
Let's go swimming in the
G7...................C
 bottom of the ocean. 

Then the little fish got so very very tired.  
But they came back to the rock. 
They put down their heads and they put down their tails and they took a little nap. 

1. And when they woke up. They were a little bit dirty. So they took a shower. 
................................C 
And they washed their hair
..................................G
 and they washed their ears.
.................................FG7
And they washed their tummies
...................................C
 and they washed their beards. 
...................................F
And they washed their nose.
.................................C
 And they washed their toes. 
.......................G n.c.
And then they said wait a minute we're fish. We don't take showers 

 
2. And when they woke up. They decided to brush their teeth. 
So they got out their toothbrush.
 And their toothpaste. 
And they squeezed a little on. 
They really liked the taste. Then they put it in their mouth. 
 They brushed north and south. 
 
Chuka chee chukka chee Chuka chee chukka chee. And then they said 

wait a minute, we're fish, we don't brush our teeth.
3. And When they woke up. They decided to ride their bicycles. 
So they rode to the left and they rode to the right. 
And road all daaaaay
 and they rode all night night night night night. 
And they rode down the hill and then faster still 
and then they said. 
Wait a minute we're fish we don't ride bicycles.

LYRICS

I was walkin‚Äô down the street
On my way to the candy shop
When it began to rain
Candy raindrops!

Chorus:

I hope it rains forever!
I wish it would never stop!
Because I like the taste
Of candy raindrops!

Skipped through sugar puddles,
No boots on my feet!
I caught the raindrops on my tongue,
And the candy was so sweet!

Chorus

I don‚Äôt want an umbrella
When it rains like this!
I just open my mouth
And hope raindrops don‚Äôt miss!

Chorus

I don‚Äôt want an umbrella
When it rains like this!
I just open my mouth
And hope raindrops don‚Äôt miss!

Chorus

Skipped through sugar puddles,
No boots on my feet!
I caught the raindrops on my tongue,
And the candy was so sweet!

Chorus

There's red and blue and purple and green
Hello yellow, orange tangerine

These are the colors of our world
These are the colors of our world

Chorus

Learing colors as we sing, colors are on everything
It should come as no surprize, there's even colors in your eyes

There's brown and green and hazel and blue
that's what I see when I look at you

Lyrics:

Five little ducks went out one day 
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only four little ducks came back
1, 2, 3, 4

Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only three little ducks came back
1, 2, 3

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only two little ducks came back
1, 2

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only one little duck came back
1

One little duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But none of the five little ducks came back

Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
And all of five little ducks came back

Five little ducks went out to play
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack, quack""
And all of the five little ducks came back!

Our ""Action Song for Kids"" is a funky and bouncy dance tune that introduces the action verbs ""clap"", ""stomp"", ""swing"", ""dance"", ""sing"", jump"", ""touch"",  and ""shake"". In the video, our robot and the little chicks present a funky choreography on the dance floor, while Mother Hen and the band are singing their hearts out! 

This song can be used in the classroom or at home to encourage learning through music and body movement. The rhythm, musical arrangement, lyrics, and animation all work together to teach action verbs in the most effective way possible!

Young learners of English will also love this video, as it is easy to sing along (lots of lines are short and repeated often) and the words are written and acted out on the screen.

The Little Boat Kids Song Lyric

There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
There was a little boat who loved to sail the ocean
It loved to sail, it loved to sail
It loved to sail around the bay

But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
But for a week or two or three or more the boat was going nowhere
It couldn't sail, it couldn't sail
It couldn't sail around the bay

And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
And if you want to sing again we'll start all over 
We'll swing around, we'll swing around
We'll swing around back to the bay

About Smart Babies:

Where kids can be happy and smart!

Today our babies and preschoolers are growing in the world with a lot of gadgets and sources of information. All of us love our children most of all, and we try to do our best to make their childhood happy, funny and interesting! Not every child likes to read books every day or sit in one place while you‚Äôre trying to teach them something new. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created Smart Babies - a channel for kids with animation, songs and nursery rhymes!

Kids will laugh, dance, sing, and play along with our videos, learning letters, numbers, animal sounds, colors, and much, much more while simply enjoying our friendly characters and fun stories.

Only $4.99 USD per month and $44.99 USD for a year!

The fruit song for kids is a fun way for children to learn some of the more common fruits we eat. The song uses an interactive call and response structure that makes it really easy to sing along. It also incorporates the days of the week, so that children can become more familiar with them.

In each verse, Little Chick talks about how she eats fruits every single day, describing which particular fruit she eats on which day. Every sentence is repeated by the Three Little Cows (and the audience).

We kept the chorus really easy, only using ""Naa, naa, naa"" as lyrics because we want the children to relax and enjoy the music in this part. You can do lots of fun things during the chorus: dance, jump, swing the arms, play the air guitar.... :D

During the breakdown, Little Chick and the Cows say the names of each fruit one more type, in a rhythmical call-and-response-chant.

Enjoy our fun Fruit Song, and feel free to share the video with friends and colleagues! Don't forget to click ""Like"" and leave comments under the video. Any kind of feedback is much appreciated as we always try to improve our materials  :-D

The Singing Walrus presets ""Vegetable Song"" - a lively motown-inspired tune that teaches the names of 9 common vegetables that we eat. Each verse introduces 3 vegetables in a fun call and response form that is easy for kids to follow. In each chorus, everyone sings along to the lines ""Vegetables for you! Vegetables for me! Vegetables for you and me!"" 

Teachers can use this video as a fun supplement for teaching fruits and vegetables in the classroom. Perfect for both native English speakers and young students of ESL/EFL!

Story : The film opens in a street in Hyderabad in a night with Krishna (Vishnu Manchu) saving Sirisha (Shanvi Srivastava) from some eve teasers and accompanying her to the hostel she stays. In the journey, they both come to know that they hail from Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man try to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva) and Seshagiri who is fond of cakes.

Krishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna is survived by his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore) and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a kid but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoil brat often terrorizing people in the name of Anna creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home and kidnaps the woman and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farm house. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for formation of Nandavaram project. Meanwhile Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.

Meanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farm house by Bhushan who trashed her brother recently. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son and none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened seeing them carrying weapons.

Finally during the death rituals of Lakshmi, the main one behind the group is revealed as Ananda Rao. His close associates hold more than 50% stake in Nandavaram project and with that money, he planned to shift to the opposition party and win the elections. Since Anna would oppose it, he wanted to murder him and joins hands with KR and his group. Krishna demands Anna that he would kill Ananda Rao. But Anna requests him and he himself murders Ananda Rao.

From Wikipedia ""An alphabet song is any of various songs used to teach children the alphabet. Alphabet songs typically follow the alphabetic principle (though the phonics method offers variants). In languages such as English with morphophonemic variation (e.g. ""cake"" is /Ààke…™k/, not [ÀàkaÀêk…õ]), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular pronunciation for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.
""The A.B.C."" /Àåe…™ÀåbiÀêÀàsiÀê/ or ""A.B.Cs"" /Àåe…™ÀåbiÀêÀàsiÀêz/ is one of the best-known English language alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as ""the alphabet song"", especially in the United States.

The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the Boston-based music publisher Charles Bradlee, and given the title ""The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte"". The musical arrangement was attributed to Louis Le Maire (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was ""Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts"", according to the Newberry Library,[1] which also says, ""The theme is that used by Mozart for his piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman.""[2] This tune is the same as the tune for ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and ""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"".
Because the English language has 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds (phonemes) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.
The group Wee Sing released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order.[citation needed] It is called ZYXs.

The Canadian children's TV series The Big Comfy Couch used a version of the song in the episode ""Backwards"" (Season 4, episode 1.) [5]

Comedian Soupy Sales released a song in 1966 called ""Backwards Alphabet"" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.[citation needed] The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with The Smothers Brothers in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of Alice Through the Looking Glass.[citation needed]

In the opening scene of the 1992 episode of Martin, Martin sings the song in the dark radio station in season 1's ""Dead Men Don't Flush"".

Five Little Monkeys Lyrics: 

Five little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!""

Four little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!""

Three little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped her head
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!""

Two little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!""

One little monkey jumping on the bed
She fell off and bumped her head
Momma called the doctor and the doctor said
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed!""

Lyric:

Time to dress the princess
Pick a colour for her dress
How about matching shoes?
Pick the nicest you can choose

Time to add a crown
One that's nice and round
A necklace looks so cool
With a big shiny jewel!

[Ahhh! She's so pretty!]

Now let's dress the next princess
Pick a colour for her dress
How about matching shoes?
Pick the nicest you can choose

Time to add a crown
One that's nice and round
A necklace looks so cool
With a big shiny jewel!

[Wow! she looks so beautiful]

‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics:
You put your right foot in, you take your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your right arm in, you take your right arm out, you put your right arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you take your left arm out, you put your left arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your head in, you take your head out, you put your head in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your knees in, you take your knees out, you put your knees in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your shoulders in, you take your shoulders out, you put your shoulders in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your elbows in, you take your elbows out, you put your elbows in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your bottom in, you take your bottom out, you put your bottom in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your quiet voice in, you take your quiet voice out, you put your quiet in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.
You put your loud voice in, you take your loud voice out, you put your loud voice in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your tummy in, you take your tummy out, you put your tummy in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your nose in, you take your nose out, you put your nose in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your whole self in, you take your whole self out, you put your whole self in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

Lyrics: The Santa Claus Song
-----------------------------------------------------

Santa Claus is getting ready
With his reindeer and his sleigh
To bring gifts for all the children
They will open Christmas day

Santa Claus, Santa Claus

Grandma says we shouldn't worry
Santa visits every year
Through the windy winter flurries
Old Saint Nick will soon be here

Here is our ""Months of the Year Song"" - a fun folk song to help kids learn all 12 months of the year. Mother Hen sings the first verse alone so the kids can become familiar with the melody. During the 2nd verse, the kids sing along with Mother Hen. During the 3rd and 4th verses, both the kids and Mother Hen sing quietly and then loudly. In the final verse, the song speeds up to give the kids a fun challenge.

This song is perfect for both English speaking children and young learners of ESL/EFL!

This super simple goodbye song is great for ending nursery school, preschool, and children's ESL/EFL classes. It's very easy to sing along with and learn through gestures, and it ends with 45 seconds of instrumental music to play as children leave the classroom. Together with our song ""Hello Hello!""

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

When the blazing sun is gone,
When there's nothing he shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

In the dark blue sky so deep
Through my curtains often peep
For you never close your eyes
Til the morning sun does rise
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

Lyrics: 
The eensy weensy spider went up the water spout. 
Down came the rain and washed the spider out. 
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain. 
Then the eensy weensy spider went up the spout again.

Okay‚Ä¶put your fingers together.
Let's do The Eensy Weensy Spider.

The eensy weensy spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain.
Then the eensy weensy spider went up the spout again.

A little faster now.

The eensy weensy spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain.
Then the eensy weensy spider went up the spout again.

Now let's try it slow, with a low voice.
And a big, big spider.

The big, big spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain.
Then the big, big spider went up the spout again.

LYRICS:

Put your apron on, wash your hands
Let‚Äôs get out some pots and pans
Cups, plates and a wooden spoon
Tap tap tap a little cooking tune

Cos cooking in the kitchen is so much fun
We‚Äôre cooking dinner for everyone
We‚Äôre cooking in the kitchen, baking a cake
So many yummy things we can make
Cook cook cook - cooking in the kitchen
Cook cook cook - cooking in the kitchen
Cook cook cook - cooking in the kitchen
Stir it stir it, mix mix mix

Let‚Äôs mix up a bowl of goo
With a little bit of water and flour too
Stir it up until it‚Äôs nice and thick
Then put it in the oven for one minute 
(tick tock tick tock) Yay!

Chorus 

Roll some dough with a rolling pin
Let‚Äôs make cookies for all our friends
Stars, squares and circles too
Cutting out shapes for me and you

Chorus

Stir it stir it - cooking in the Kitchen
Mix it mix it - cooking in the Kitchen
Whisk it whisk it - cooking in the Kitchen
Roll it roll it - cooking in the kitchen 

Chorus 

And when we‚Äôre done, we wash up and put everything away,
So all our cooking things are ready for our next cooking day

Cook! Cook! Cooking in the kitchen
Cook! Cook! Cooking in the kitchen
Cook! Cook! Cooking in the kitchen!",\'kids\' songs\',true

This is a cumulative song that's great for learning all about nature! You can sing the verses in a call and response format, and then see if you can keep up with each of the choruses as they get longer and longer. This song teaches the key nature vocabulary woods, grass, hole, tree, branch, nest, egg, and bird!  üé∂ And the green grass grew all around, all around. And the green grass grew all around.üé∂

Lyrics:
Out in the woods. 
There was a tree. 
The prettiest tree.
That you ever did see.

Well, the tree was in a hole,
and the hole was in the ground.
And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

And on this tree. 
There was a branch.
The prettiest branch. 
That you ever did see. 

Well, the branch was on the tree, 
and the tree was in the hole,
and the hole was in the ground.
And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

And on this branch.
There was a nest.
The prettiest nest. 
That you ever did see. 

Well, the nest was on the branch,¬†
and the branch was on the tree, 
and the tree was in the hole,
and the hole was in the ground.
And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

And in this nest.
There was an egg.¬† 
The prettiest egg. 
That you ever did see. 

Well, the egg was in the nest,
and the nest was on the branch, 
and the branch was on the tree, 
and the tree was in the hole,
and the hole was in the ground.
And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

And in this egg.
There was a bird.¬† 
The prettiest bird. 
That you ever did see.

Well, the bird was in the egg, 
and the egg was in the nest,
and the nest was on the branch, 
and the branch was on the tree, 
and the tree was in the hole,
and the hole was in the ground.
And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

And the green grass grew all around, all around.
And the green grass grew all around.

Lyrics: 
We‚Äôll roll the snow
Into a big ball
To make the bottom of a snowman - Freeze!

We‚Äôll pat the snow
Around that big ball
We‚Äôve got the bottom of a snowman - Freeze!
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 
  
We‚Äôll roll the snow
Into a medium ball
To make the middle of the snowman-Freeze!

We‚Äôll pat the snow
Around that medium ball
We‚Äôve got the middle of the snowman - Freeze!    
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 

We‚Äôll roll the snow
Into a small ball
To make the head of the snowman - Freeze!
We‚Äôll pat the snow
Around that small ball
We‚Äôve got the head of the snowman - Freeze! 
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 

We‚Äôll use some rocks or coal
For his mouth and eyes 
A carrot for his nose, 
That‚Äôs no surprise
Some twigs for his arms
From some fallen trees
A scarf and hat
We‚Äôve got our snowman ‚Äì Freeze!

We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze! 
We‚Äôll make a snowman. We‚Äôll make a snowman.
We‚Äôll make a snowman. Freeze!
