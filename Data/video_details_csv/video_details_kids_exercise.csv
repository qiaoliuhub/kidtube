She lives 250 miles from my house. Her parents were nice enough to allow me, a perfect stranger, to come in and share their daughter with the world. Thank you, again. My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist from the United States. I hope to follow Myla as she develops. I hope to teach ideas to help her learn to move, crawl, sit and walk. I started this video series after questions came in from all over the world from people seeking assistance in helping children with low tone. The ideas I teach in this video are not appropriate for a much weaker child than the one featured in this video. I hope you find this idea useful and simple. 

My website is www.pediatricPTexercises.com  My Facebook page is Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises. My informational books, ""A is for Autism,""  ""C is for Cerebral Palsy,"" ""D is for Down Syndrome,"" ""Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Hips""  and ""Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Knees"" are available on Amazon. ""A is for ADHD"" should be available shortly. Do not hesitate to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com with questions, concerns or favorable reviews! Please note I am unable to provide treatment recommendations for a child I have not personally evaluated.

I am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos. I have reviewed and corrected the closed captions for this video so that you might understand what I am saying even if you don't speak English. I hope the directions below are helpful to you.

Friends show us what they‚Äôre growing in their home gardens. So many things and in all colors of the rainbow: watermelon, cucumbers, squash and tomato. Other things that are growing are a red pepper, a green pepper and an eggplant. Herbs are growing in another friend‚Äôs garden and they smell so good.

Every color of food has nutrients that make them powerful and give you the energy you need to play and feel great. Children talk about their favorite fruits and veggies to eat, including apples, carrots and cucumbers. The families are so glad when they have visitors like you and Zobey. The garden's always growing, so come back and see what they have next time. 

Children will learn about gardening and the fruits, vegetables and herbs that they can grow at home. Growing fresh food means that children have a fun, ongoing project and can enjoy what they grow. Healthy foods give you all the energy you need to play and feel great. So, when you eat fruits and veggies every day, your body says, ""Thank you.""

He got interested in this particular kind of sport as a kid. While studying at high school, he could already boast of a number of titles and at college, he was already representing Oklahoma Sooners. 
In 2009 his NBA career began with playing for Los Angeles Clippers. He had been a part of the team for many years until transferring to Detroit Pistons in 2018. Also, the athlete was selected for All-Star games the whole 6 times.
Griffin is accustomed to set goals and works really hard to make his dreams come true. But is he that successful in his personal life? Let‚Äôs find it out right now!

The celebrity‚Äôs father Tommy also used to play basketball in youth. After that he worked as a coach and was even a coach of the year in 1975, 1980 and 1994. It was Tommy, who inspired Blake to play and took responsibility for training him. In addition to that, he owned a gym.

The mother‚Äôs name is Gail and she worked as a schoolteacher but is now retired. She is very proud of her stellar son‚Äôs career heights in the sports industry and can be sometimes seen at his games, supporting him as much as she can.

The sportsman has a three-year older brother Taylor, who was born in 1986. He was also a part of the sports industry playing for Phoenix Suns, Dakota Wizards, Santa Cruz Warriors and other teams. He retired in 2016 and started dealing with Blake‚Äôs multiple ventures. In such a way, he is now a Program Director of Team Griffin Basketball, a Chief Operating Officer at Blake Griffin Enterprises and a President of Team Griffin Foundation. As for his personal life, he is happily married to a woman named Marieka and together they raise two kids.

Coming closer to the athlete‚Äôs relationship status, in 2011 he started dating Brynn Cameron, who used to work as sports marketing executive and an interior decorator. In addition to that she also tried her hand in acting and can be seen in a movie called Southland of the Heart. 
In 2013 the pair welcomed their firstborn and in 2016 one more kid joined the family. The couple was already going to get married but Griffin shocked Brynn with a prenuptial agreement. In 2017 they called it quits but kept co-parenting their two children.

In 2013 a son Ford was delivered. It would be interesting to know that during one of the interviews, the athlete shared that parenthood changed him a lot and made a better person. He also added that it made him think about things in a different way.

In 2016 a daughter Finley became a cute addition to the family. Both children live with their mother but often spend time with dad. For instance, when Finley was 3, Blake took her and Ford to Disneyland for a celebration.
That is all.

We're going to show you two variations on how to do child's pose when you're pregnant. Child's pose is wonderful for opening up the lower back and the hips. So with child's pose, when you're pregnant, you have a belly to accommodate for. So Vicky's going to take her knees a lot wider than she normally would. From there, keeping her hips back, walk her hands forward until maybe her head can rest on the floor. Good. Then you can really stretch your arms forward. Stretch them nice and long. They don't have to be parallel. They can be slightly separated. With the forehead on the floor, just going to breathe gently, letting the air go all the way down the spine. Letting the hips relax towards the heels. Very nice. Come up. Bring your hands back, and lift your chest.

There's another variation for when you can't get down. Maybe your back is a little tighter. We're going to put two blocks on the floor, one for under the chest, one for under the head. Then we'll put a comfy bolster on top. Good. Vicky is going to lean forward. You may have to adjust this, and pull this a little bit for you. Good. Then the blocks make a lovely hole for her to put her arms through it. It's just like hugging a pillow. You'll have one cheek on the side so the neck can stretch out a little bit. The shoulder blades can relax off to the side, so the upper back gets a little bit room to breathe. The lower back and hips continue to stretch. Whenever you're ready, you can slowly bring your hands underneath your shoulders. Use your arms to assist you as you come up. Child's pose, you can do for as long as you need to, especially if you're feeling really tired. Stay there for five minutes, or if you just need a quick break, you can be there for about five to ten seconds.",Kids exercise,true

Benefits of Exercise?

Kids who are active will have stronger muscles and bones, have a leaner body because exercise helps control body fat, be less likely to become overweight, decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,possibly lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, have a better outlook on life.

Besides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, kids who are physically fit sleep better and are better able to handle physical and emotional challenges.

The Three Elements of Fitness will be covered in our DVD. They include: endurance, strength and flexibility.

HealthWorks! Healthy Living Series: Teaching Kids to Exercise at a Young Age
by The Center for Better Health and Nutrition/HealthWorks! at Cincinnati Children's

Chelsey Lambert, Exercise Physiologist: ""Teaching kids to exercise at an early age is important because these habits are more likely to carry on when they get older.""

""Three important things to remember when focusing on younger kids and exercise is: Make it Fun. They will most likely lose interest if it's boring.""

""Make the exercise age appropriate. For example, planks for 60 seconds would not be appropriate for younger children.""

""Use imagination. Animal noises, sounds, shapes, different mindful exercises are always fun.""

""Here are a few helpful tips and ideas to help your preschooler exercise instead of screen time. Try an obstacle course. An obstacle course can help with coordination, large motor skills, concentration and team building. Cheer other kids on. Another great way to get younger kids moving is to try a scavenger hunt. This could be indoors or outdoors. Scavenger hunts help teach kids to walk longer distance and keep their mind engaged. Learn about nature or a specific topic.""

""If you feel your child needs more quiet time but still want to decrease screen time, try a yoga video or yoga poses. Yoga is great for helping kids and help them with balance, core strength and flexibility.""

""Dancing is also a fun way to keep kids moving. Try dancing with props, use ribbons or silly costumes that help to keep it fun. Try dances that they can remember. Play different games with music, for example, freeze tag, red light green light, hula hoop or jump rope.""

""It's important to let children move. Very important, very important. You know if you think about it, a baby in utero is free. He's in that warm aqueous environment where he can kick. He can even roll over and then he's born into a world in which now he has one gravity pushing him down,  he's in a big fat body, he has to learn very quickly how to move in that new environment.  The question is, are we gonna help him or are we gonna hinder him? Are we going to put him on his belly without a lot of heavy clothes and blankets and get down on the floor with him and encourage him to move, or are we going to bundle him up  in five blankets? That's really confining him from the neck down and when we do that, the baby must think you're crazy. He needs to move."" Janet Doman

Follow the directions in the song.
Stop and Go songs stimulate the frontal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes allow us to set and achieve goals, and have impulse control and empathy for others. Move and Freeze is an action song for children that helps you achieve!
Lyrics:
Chorus:
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put your right hand on your left knee, 
your left hand on your right.
Your knees move in and out. 
Your hands stay tight.
Now keep on with your moving 
but switch hands on your knees.
Keep on moving in and out till we say freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put one hand across your shoulder 
one hand across your back.
Now jump in place. Do you like it like that?
Now switch hands across your shoulders 
and switch hands across your back.
Now just be nimble, just be quick, just like Jack.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
Everybody shake your body from your head down to your feet.
And don‚Äôt stop shaking until we stop the beat.
Shake it to the east and shake it to the west.
Shake it, shake it, shake it with my friends who are the best.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
Put your right hand on your head, your left on someone‚Äôs knee.
Now turn once in a circle and buzz like a bee.
Now turn the other way, don‚Äôt let go or lose your spot.
Keep turning left, keep turning right until the music stops.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
‚ÄúAlright, you can move now.‚Äù

Evidence suggests that increasing physical activity and physical fitness may improve academic performance. Basic cognitive functions related to attention and memory facilitate learning, and these functions are enhanced by physical activity.

Folks, especially parents, guardians and kids, intoeing is common in my practice and it really lead me to write up, plan, shoot and edit THIS VIDEO because as a parent myself, when you see your child or anyone in your social circle walk with their feet intoeing, you get a little bit concerned. 

In this video, I will show you a simple workout that anyone from 1 year old to 1000 years old can do to help correct their intoeing and restore better equilibrium to their walking, running and jumping!    Let‚Äôs gooo!

Alrighty folks, thank you for watching my video and if you have any questions and comments, then please drop them in the comments below the video! And also, if you‚Äôre finding the content relatable, enjoyable and insightful, then let‚Äôs stay in touch by you punching that ‚Äòsubscribe button‚Äô and tapping that ‚Äòbell button‚Äô to stay in the ‚Äòknow‚Äô when new content arrives!


Do you know why your child or you walk with intoeing? Or pigeon toes? 3 main reasons : metatarsus adductus, nternal tibial torsion   , increased femoral anteversion.

Folks, this is not a WHY AND HOW VIDEO. There‚Äôs plenty of it on Google and YouTube, however, I‚Äôll link an article I wrote a while ago that will go through Intoeing. 

This video is about taking ACTION dammit! We need to take action to make change. 
1/ The first action I request you do is to watch and enjoy this video! Take notes if you need too! 

2/ The second action is to make an appointment with your local Podiatrist who specialises in children so that they can assess the extent of intoeing. The truth is, if the extent of intoeing is quite severe on imaging and physical assessments, surgery is a possibility. However, I understand that you may not want that or be comfortable with that. Go see your local Podiatrist. 

3/ The third action is to APPLY this simply exercise circuit for 15-20 minutes a day. If you‚Äôre an adult, add this to your exercise workout, if you‚Äôre a busy parent, then you have my permission to act like a kid and make this a fun and interactive workout with your children! Ok? It‚Äôs spending quality time with your children.

Remember the goal of this workout is strengthen hip and thigh muscles to encourage more hip outward rotation and reduce hip inward rotation! Thereby reducing intoeing! 

[SEND ME YOUR VIDEOS DOING THIS WORKOUT ON INSTAGRAM - TAG ME @THE_FOOT_MECHANIC WITH THE HASHTAG #FEETANDCO so i can have a look!]

Ok, so here is the program which I call the ‚ÄúThe Penguin‚Äù workout. 

THE PENGUIN WORKOUT

1/  Big Bear walks
2/ Sumo Frog Jumps
3/ Cheeky Crab Walks
4/ Penguin Walks

I want you and your kids to do each workout 5-10 reps [define reps] as a progressional circuit. They will repeat this circuit at least 3-4 times. 

I‚Äôm going to demonstrate this workout! Firstly, prepare the training area - outdoor, grass, soft surface areas with markers to map out the course. The great thing is that your course can be straight or with turns whichever fits well with your home or outdoor area! Once set up, Then you can proceed. 


What did you think folks?! Hmm. i thought it was a pretty good video! Now folks, I‚Äôd love for you to share you and your family‚Äôs playtime doing The Penguin workout on my Instagram by tagging my Insta name  : @the_foot_mechanic and hashtag it with #feetandco!

Ok! That‚Äôs it for me on this video, but if you have any questions and or comments, post them below and I‚Äôll get to replying asap! 

Oh and don‚Äôt forget to check out my recent video about the terrible night cramps! You‚Äôll need to watch it to help your flexibility for the Penguin Workout!

These kids exercises were designed or suggested by kids (my daughter), so you know it's going to work for hahaha :D

The kids fitness routine includes full body exercises, head to toe! We have:
- frog jumps, rabbit jumps, kangaroo jumps and more for leg exercises. 
- Crab crawls, supermans, beetle crawls and more for core exercises.
- And then we have helicopters, bird wings and arm circles and others for arm exercises. 
- On top of that we make time to train kids balance with special exercises for that too, so EVERYTHING is included!

This one is the longest of the easy beginner's set, running for a full 30 minutes straight. For that reason you can choose your own pace, whether you want to train at a very high intensity and really work up a sweat (like me, Mr. Ten Thousand) or just get moving and have great fun (like my little girl). It's up to you! Even if you need to slow down a bit, do your best NOT to stop :D

It is important to consider why there is low tone or poor core strength as this may help to determine what sort of exercises will help. For example if tone is low due to neurological issues then simple exercises that only target the core will only have a minimal effect, such a child will require a more substantial neurologically targeted program of exercise.

17,2PcCmxEW5WA,Two minutes Mindfulness: Balloon Breaths/Belly Breaths - Breathing exercise for Children,"meditation,mindful meditation,belly breaths,balloon breaths","Balloon breathing is a simple breathing exercise that you can do anywhere. Slow, deep breaths are one of the best ways to calm an anxious child.
 
An anxious or angry child is in flight-or-fight mode with their body primed to handle a perceived threat. This usually leads to fast, shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and tense muscles. Practicing slow, deep breathing tells your body that it can calm down, and as the physical arousal decreases, the emotional feeling of anxiety or anger will too.
 
Here‚Äôs a sample of how I talk to kids about deep breathing for relaxation:
 
‚ÄúWhen we get scared or worried or angry, we usually take quick shallow breaths that stay at the top of our chest. (I put my hand on the top of my chest to give a focal point and demonstrate what this looks like.) When we want to calm down, we need to take slow belly breaths instead. Imagine that there is a balloon in your belly. When you breathe in, you want to push all the air down and fill up the balloon so that your belly puffs out. (I put my hand on my belly and demonstrate this.) Then, you breathe out slowly and your belly gets smaller as the balloon deflates.‚Äù
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to practice belly breaths if you lay down. I‚Äôll have the child lay on the couch and we‚Äôll put a small stuffed animal (or balloon) on their stomach. I‚Äôll remind them that when they breathe in, the stuffed animal should rise, and when they breathe out, it should go down. We‚Äôll practice this until they seem to understand how to do the belly breaths.
 
After they understand the belly breathing, I‚Äôll help them slow down the breathing like this:
 
‚ÄúTo keep our breathing slow, we‚Äôll try to count to four as we breathe in and to four as we breathe out. Let‚Äôs practice and do five slow breaths together; I‚Äôll count as we go. Try to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe out, purse your lips like you‚Äôre blowing bubbles. Put one hand on your stomach to remind yourself to focus on filling up your belly when you breathe in. In ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 ‚Äì 4. Out ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 ‚Äì 4‚Ä¶‚Äù

WARM UP STRETCHES 
Use this stretching fitness video I made with simple exercises from the FREE ""SWORKIT"" Fitness Stretching App. 
We usually use the app but for this video I used screen-casted selected stretches, then edited them to a 15:5 interval timer in ""Tabata"" format. 

In this fitness warm up, there are 8 rounds. Each round has 15 seconds of work, with 5 seconds of rest in between. Copy the 'Sworkit' characters and focus on your movements and breathing.

Music: Chill Lofi ""Days Like These""
Huge shoutout to SWORKIT for helping to create this instructional tool for our students!
https://sworkit.com/
______________________________________________
TABATA FITNESS WORKOUT.      
TABATA is a form of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) used by fitness programs ranging from elementary PE to professional athletes. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the fitness program is as follows:

Work out hard for 20-30 seconds...
Rest for 10 seconds...
REPEAT.
Complete 8 rounds.

You push yourself as hard as you can for 20-30 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each fitness exercise. 

This is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.

RECOVERY/MINDFULNESS.        
""Hey everybody! Coach Meger here, and welcome to mindful minutes.
For the next few minutes, we‚Äôre just going to relax our bodies and focus on our breathing....""

Mindful Reminders:
Remember to take deep, slow, even breaths.
In through your nose, out through your mouth.
Get comfortable. Let your body and mind relax.
Allow your mind to blank and only focus on your breathing.

Now, close your eyes, or you may watch the screen.
Breathe‚Ä¶ Relax...""

Like adults, kids need exercise. Most children need at least an hour of physical activity every day. Regular exercise helps children

    Feel less stressed
    Feel better about themselves
    Feel more ready to learn in school
    Keep a healthy weight
    Build and keep healthy bones, muscles and joints
    Sleep better at night

As kids spend more time watching TV, they spend less time running and playing. Parents should limit TV, video game and computer time. Parents can set a good example by being active themselves. Exercising together can be fun for everyone. Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to school, dancing, bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get exercise.

_____________________________________________
WARM UP STRETCHES 
Use this stretching fitness video I made with simple exercises from the FREE ""SWORKIT"" Fitness Stretching App. 
We usually use the app but for this video I used screen-casted selected stretches, then edited them to an interval timer in ""Tabata"" format. 

In this fitness warm up, there are 8 rounds. Each round has 15 seconds of work, with 5 seconds of rest in between. Copy the 'Sworkit' characters and focus on your movements and breathing.

Music: Chill Lofi ""Days Like These""
Huge shoutout to SWORKIT for helping to create this instructional tool for our students!
https://sworkit.com/
______________________________________________
TABATA FITNESS WORKOUT.      
TABATA is a form of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) used by fitness programs ranging from elementary PE to professional athletes. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the fitness program is as follows:

Work out hard for 20-30 seconds...
Rest for 10 seconds...
REPEAT.
Complete 8 rounds.

You push yourself as hard as you can for 20-30 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each fitness exercise. 

This is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.

RECOVERY/MINDFULNESS.       
""Hey everybody! Coach Meger here, and welcome to mindful minutes.
For the next few minutes, we‚Äôre just going to relax our bodies and focus on our breathing....""

Mindful Reminders:
Remember to take deep, slow, even breaths.
In through your nose, out through your mouth.
Get comfortable. Let your body and mind relax.
Allow your mind to blank and only focus on your breathing.

Now, close your eyes, or you may watch the screen.
Breathe‚Ä¶ Relax...""

This cool kid-friendly song starts out with a message about staying healthy and fit and having fun counting to 100 together.
It's a great count to 100 song for Kindergarten.
I show the children simple, easy - to - do exercises for each 10 numbers. Children have a variety of gross motor movements to do as they count to 100. 
    The songs great beat and steady counting motivate children to keep moving all the way to 100. We show the numbers  from 1 to 100 very large and clear so children also get the visual number recognition and stimulation. 
    This count to 100 song will engage your children with the catchy up tempo music, the clear numeral visuals and seeing Jack sing and demonstrate the exercises.
     Use Count to 100 - Let's Get Fit every day to strengthen your children's ability to count to 100 and help them enjoy and have fun exercising  too.
     Counting to 100 and basic number recognition is a standard in most early childhood ( pre-k, K and 1st grade)  classrooms.

This is a great math song to start your day with, as a brain break or use it during indoor recess. 

PE Teachers will love it too as it emphasizes physical education and aerobic exercise as children count to 100.

My daughter Faith is featured in this video with me because she really enjoys working out with mommy.  I do not even have to ask her.  I just say, I'm going to workout and there she is... my little shadow.  My daughter Phoebe on the other hand is a tad more laid back.  However, both of my children know how important living a healthy lifestyle is.  I am not a psycho forcing them to lose weight.  I simply feed them a balanced diet, and get them moving.  I refuse to let my children follow in my childhood footsteps of ever eating... weight problems and being teased for the same.  I hope that you can get a little laugh out of this at some points, and that maybe it inspires you to get up and moving with your own children.  The workout featured herein is Les Mills COMBAT Power HIIT.  If you have not checked this program out, I highly recommend it.  Great results in very little time.  Go to my site http://www.beachbodycoach.com/lisakingslayer and click on the Featured program to watch a short video on Combat.

Good habits rub off on kids.  My daughter sees me working out and she is now on her own fitness mission. I bought her Tony & The Kids and she LOVES it.  She recognizes Tony Horton from my P90X videos & is star struck. The moves are fun, and shockingly, many of them are in P90X as well! 

It's a silly, fun dvd. Tony shows his goofy side but it's perfect for this dvd.  I say it's great for small kids and it gets them active while being indoors without breaking the furniture!

My Alphabet Workout song - Upper Case follows the Zaner - Bloser instructions for writing the upper case letters to develop the exercise movements and verbal letter formation directions. 

This song incorporates visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning. Gross motor movements are used to form the letters to enhance physical activity. Children follow my movements as I form the upper case letters of the alphabet. 

The more we engage our children in movement, the more we really are strengthening their health and well-being. I made the letters as large as possible so your children can clearly see and watch me form the letters. 

Play this song every day to help your children get great practice forming the letters and making body and brain connections.

Song Lyrics 

Now we are alone,
All alone in the dark
What‚Äôs that shadow? What could it be? 
It looks like a monster to me

Let‚Äôs check and see
Where is it coming from?
It must be a monster, I‚Äôm afraid
Phew! It was just in our heads

Once upon a time
there was a big/scary wolf 
howling so loud and its eyes so bright
No one came out at night.

Look it‚Äôs dark outside,
we‚Äôre alone in the dark.
What‚Äôs that noise, behind the door?
Now I can‚Äôt see anymore

Oh no, who‚Äôs there?
Do you see what I see?
It‚Äôs so creepy! I‚Äôm so scared
We hide all and then we all wait

There it was again
I need to go and check
Let‚Äôs be brave, let‚Äôs find out 
Phew, just a bush outside

Oh I am so scared
Let‚Äôs stay here and wait
No, no go, stay with us
it‚Äôs so scary out there

There it was again
What‚Äôs behind that door?
Just a toy car/ shining at night 
No need to be afraid

Something just moved!
It‚Äôs getting closer to us
it‚Äôs so scary, I‚Äôm so scared
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not in my head

What was that noise?
Looks like a branch to me
It‚Äôs not a monster, just a tree
No need to be afraid

Sway your arms back and forth wipe the rain away

Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Your body is amazing it can do so many things

So keep your body healthy, treat it like a friend
Take care of it and eat good foods
And keep it movin'

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try

Everybody let's move
Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove

TABATA is a form of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) used by fitness programs ranging from elementary PE to professional athletes. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the program is as follows:

Work out hard for 20 seconds...
Rest for 10 seconds...
REPEAT.
Complete 8 rounds.

You push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise. 

Music: ""Old Town Road"" feat Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus

This is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.

I invite you to put on your imagination hat and join me on many fun, easy and exciting journeys across different realms. Parents: I have designed these physical activities and home workouts to help kids move more while learning and enjoying themselves. 

My name is Dasch Barber, and I have been a professional personal trainer for over 10 years. I have a passion for fitness and for helping others become better versions of themselves. Recently, I became a Dad, which motivated me to switch my focus to wanting to help children move more while still being kids and have fun in the process. Exercise is meant to be a form of fun and movement, especially at the early development stages. I absolutely love knowing that kids watching this are having fun and moving at the same time.

Grab a coin and get ready to do physical activity.

How this game works: You will need a coin and you will have 10 seconds to flip and find out if you got heads or tails. You will have to comply with 30 seconds depending on the result of your launch and you will see if you are lucky and do something simple or you are not lucky and will do a more intense exercise.

Good luck and have fun!

30,LN39MfLto20,Strength Training For Young Athletes | Cincinnati Children's,[],"The role of strength training in youth sports has long been a point of contention among parents, coaches and even doctors. Much of that has to do with a lack of understanding and myths about the subject.

You might be surprised to learn that whether your child is ready for strength training has more to do with the maturity of their mind than their body. If your child is mentally ready to listen to coaches and understand the rules of sports, they are most likely ready to comprehend the direction needed to safely start a resistance training program to build strength and help avoid injury.

Exercises for ages 6 - 9:

Squat Holds
- Instruct the children to get in a squat stance and add in small ball toss.

Leap Frog
 - Instruct the larger child jump over smaller child.

Plank

Today, we welcome back Teacher Naomi and her son Noah who help explain the concepts of identity and race. Learn how scientists and society sometimes study and group people based on similarities. Then, listen to the difference between grouping in a good way (to build community) versus grouping in a bad way (racism). Getting to know people, rather than making judgments about skin color, is an important step in building a healthy community. 

Continue the conversation with Caroline and Sophie as they talk about similarities and differences, like where they‚Äôre from, how they speak, and their family customs and traditions. Then read along to the story ‚ÄúGot to Be Me‚Äù by Cynthia Platt. Meet T-Rex the dinosaur who dared to be different. Finally, enjoy a diverse selection of artwork made by friends around the world! 

This video is the second in a series that explains the values of diversity, race, and justice to young children. Our special guest, Naomi O‚ÄôBrien, is a teacher, author, mother, and advocate for social justice. Learn more about Naomi at https://readlikearockstarteaching.com/. 

The series is aligned with the guidelines for anti-bias education from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. NAEYC curriculum goals include helping to develop a child‚Äôs positive personal identity, empathy towards others, and the awareness of fairness. 

We‚Äôd love to hear your child‚Äôs story. Send their pictures or drawings to our team at http://khan.co/KhanKids-SubmitYourArt. When we hear more stories, we have more to share and celebrate!

Alright you guys, remember the 'simple step'? If not, here is a review. Today we are going to be learning the 'simple step'--Kid 'N Play style. Just a review of the 'simple step'; it was just walking forwards and back. I want you take 4 steps forward, and 4 steps back, alright? 

1-2-3-4, and BACK 2-3-4, FORWARDS. 

Remember this one? You may have caught this video. It's very simple. It's just a basic step to warm you up to get the cardio going. Now, we are going to it Kid 'N Play style, so we are going to start to funk it up a little bit. 

You are going to step forward on right, then your left, then your right, and then pick your left foot up and hit. Then back on your left, right, back--and then check this out--touch the floor. OK? If you can't touch the floor, go halfway down. 

Let's do that again, slow.

Right foot. 1-2-3, pick the left foot up, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, TAP, or half way. 

Okay. One more time; slow. 

1-2-3- KICK, 1-2-3-DOWN .

Now, I want you to take it up a notch, because the cardio is what you need to get going, so that you are burning calories, so that you are getting your sweat on, and you're not being lazy, right?!

Here we go: Starting with the right foot, stepping forward we have: 

1-2-3-STEP, BACK 2-3-and DOWN, 1-2-, STEP-BACK 2-, and DOWN, 1-2, STEP-BACK 2-,and DOWN, 1-2-,HIT 

Last one; hold it here. 

HOLD.

Good! OK? So as we noticed, we only were doing it to the right. OK, so let's take it to the left--slow to start--so that you are even, and you are not just doing it on one side. 

Step forward with your left foot. Yes?

1-2-3- pick it up, and BACK- 2- 3-, and DOWN, 

Again,

LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT- pick it up, and RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, all the way. You can always go halfway if you need to

Now we are going to try it up to speed starting with the left foot.

Ready, set, go. 

And 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2-3-DOWN, 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2--One more! 1-2-3-UP, BACK-2-3-HOLD.
 
Okay! Good! So you can take that either side, starting with the right, starting with the left. It's up to you; just take a break in between. Give it a shot! Enjoy!",Kids exercise,true

35,mHkwUIS9_UA,"Ask Dean - Yoga for overweight people, child's pose, and body weight exercises",[],"This week I talk about a topic that I really enjoy talking about - yoga for overweight people. The short answer - yes, yoga is absolutely okay to do if you are overweight. Much better than almost any other form of exercise I can think of. It's low-impact, teaches you to basic movement patterns that you can use in any form of fitness, and you are much less likely to get injured doing yoga instead of cardio or something else that your body is simply not ready for. I also talk about how to do child's pose properly, and feel an even stretch throughout the back. Finally, how I maintain my own physique, and the value of bodyweight exercises.

Healthy fun

Not only in the US, where every third child is either obese or overweight, but also in other parts of the world, kids are becoming less and less healthy. Being overweight isn't just about others calling your child fat, but it's far more than that. It has a whole set of other health problems and issues, which can have serious consequences.
Off course lifestyle changes, which are needed to tackle this problem, can be an impossibly difficult task. Most fail just because they try to make all the changes in one day. But it's not that simple. The best way is to make gradual improvements, such as lowering the daily food intake or slowly implementing a healthier diet.
Motivating an overweight child to exercise can be especially challenging. If possible, it is wise to try introducing physical activity through a familiar medium. Since most kids watch cartoons and like stories, why not use that to your (and their) advantage?  Children workout as a part of playing a sport they like or just by doing what regular kids do. Kids exercising doesn't have to be a chore but it can be a fun experience. Why not try an interactive kids app (we all know kids love our iPads) which gets our young ones to exercise, dance and have fun while doing it. TV or computer time can work to your advantage; you just have to know how to do it.

Yuvi -- Story Aerobics for kids is an incredibly fun and entertaining way for kids to become more active. The ten part series was developed in collaboration with experts in the fields of child development and professional training. To ensure the best possible product our team of incredible artists worked towards the goal of being the most beneficial entertainment for growing preschool and older children. Not only does Yuvi -- Story Aerobics help develop kids motor skills and has health benefits, but it is also incredibly successful at encouraging the development of their imagination, creativity and reasoning.
The vision of Yuvi -- Story Aerobics creation goes far beyond producing kids' entertainment. We strive towards making the best interactive programming for the mind, body and soul. Throughout the incredible journey of Yuvi, our lovable main character, kids not only happily exercise, but also learn valuable lessons of working towards a goal, the importance of teamwork and compassion. And the best part is that they are having lots of fun while doing it!

Yuvi-story aerobics for kids takes you on an exciting adventure through ten beautiful stories. Everyone gets a chance to help Yuvi save all the toys in the world. They were stolen by wizard Zorkus who has hidden them into his enchanted land. The stories are designed in a way that motivates kids to exercise. They can develop their imagination and motor skills, while having incredible fun. Help your kids stay healthy fit and happy. Join Yuvi on his magical adventure!

In the first episode Yuvi lands in enchanted Africa, where wizard Zorkus has hidden all of our balls. To save them he has to face dangerous birds, hungry lions and a herd of buffalo.

In the first episode Yuvi will save all the balls that wizard Zorkus has stolen. He's hidden them in enchanted Africa. If Yuvi wants to save the balls, he will need the help of every child in the world because the balls are being guarded by dangerous birds, hungry lions and a herd of giant buffalo.
To help Yuvi avoid the birds, we have to squat down to the ground. We're also going to pretend that we are trees to fool the lions and at the end we will chase away a herd of giant buffalo. If we make it, Yuvi will teach us the dance of happiness!",Kids exercise,false

These factors have an effect on the lives of our children and their mental state making them prone to depression, attention deficit, and mental and physical weariness.
An exercise to improve mental health. We all take care of our health. Everybody crave for a healthy, fit and beautiful body. To achieve healthy, fit and beautiful body we take proper care to follow a healthy diet, do some manageable workout, stick to some beauty products and try to make ourselves presentable. But, very few think about one vital aspect i.e. a healthy, fit and beautiful body is only meaningful if we have powerful memory. To be precise we should have a fit and healthy brain and powerful memory which will make us competent in every sphere of life.

Though memory power decreases according to age, as many people develop the disease of alzheimer that causes mental deterioration in middle or old age. But, some people have weak memory due to accident or major change in life like when a woman have baby, her whole life is changed. This sudden change often weaken her memory power. In other cases some children are slow learner by birth. Such children find difficulty in memorizing their lessons or forget soon after they memorize them. Whatever may be the causes, we can improve our memory by following some simple exercises, some useful product or keeping our brain busy. As anything which are not in use get rusted and become useless after some time the brain also need to be used constantly to keep it healthy and active.

Earlier, people used to have the habit of writing diary. Slowly this good habit is forgotten due to hectic life style and high tech gadgets. People are so engrossed with their newly found so many amazing high tech gadgets that they are forgetting their old good habits. In fact, writing diary improves our memory miraculously. If you do not want to write a diary, every night before going to sleep recollect everything that happened from morning till night within your mind. This is the best exercise of our brain. Do it and see he miracle. This is the most simple and cheap technique to improve memory power.",Kids exercise,true

Exercise is very important to stay active. But it does not have to be only at gym class. It can be something fun too. Playing is not just fun but also keeps you physically active.

Benefits of Exercise -
There are a lot of benefits from regular exercise. Kids who are active will:

- have stronger¬†muscles and bones
- be less likely to become¬†overweight
- decrease the risk of developing¬†type 2 diabetes
- lower¬†blood pressure¬†and blood cholesterol levels
- have a better outlook on life

Besides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, kids who are physically fit sleep better. They're also better able to handle physical and emotional challenges ‚Äî from running to catch a bus to studying for a test.

The Three Elements of Fitness - 
The three elements of fitness in action when kids play in the playground are:

1. Endurance: When a child is chasing or being chased by another child at play.
2. Strength: When a child crosses a monkey bar.
3. Flexibility: Bending down to tie their shoes. 

Regular aerobic activity helps a child to build good endurance levels. Aerobic exercise causes the heart to beat faster and a person breathes harder. Regular aerobic activity strengthens the heart and improves the body's ability to deliver oxygen to all its cells.

Following are some fun aerobic activities:

- basketball
- bicycling
- ice skating
- soccer
- swimming
- tennis
- walking
- jogging
- running

Improving strength doesn't have to be only from only lifting weights instead, kids can do push-ups, stomach crunches, pull-ups, and other exercises to help tone and strengthen muscles. They also improve their strength when they climb, do a handstand, or wrestle.

Stretching exercises helps a child improve¬†flexibility, allowing muscles and joints to bend and move easily through their full range of motion. Simplest activities like reaching out for a toy or practicing a split or doing a cartwheel are fun ways to stretch and build one‚Äôs flexibility.

It is an inverted posture which provides many of the same benefits of the seated forward bend: the main physical benefit is to stretch the entire backside of the body from the head to the heels.

1) To begin this posture, you should first come to Tadasana (Mountain Pose). Keep your hands on your hips and your feet either together or at the width of your hips. Breathe out and bend forward from the joints of your hips and not from the waist. As you come down, bring the front of your torso away from the groin area and open up the space between the sternum and the pubis. Just as it is with all forward bends, the importance is on elongating the front of the torso as you come into the position.
2) Bend forward with your knees kept straight if you are able to. Keep your hands under your feet with the palms facing up and bring your toes to touch your wrist.
3) While breathing in, straighten your arms and raise the front of the torso away from the thighs. At this point, your back should look concave. Remain in this position for a few breaths and then breathe out and stretch forward and down. Bend your elbows to the side so that they frame the head. Bring the shoulder blades down the back while maintaining some space between the ears and shoulders. Your weight should be distributed evenly through the feet. Raise your sitting bones upward to the ceiling. The top of your thighs should be turned inwards in bit.
4) Each time you breathe in during the pose, you should stretch and lift the torso a little. Each time you breathe out, release a little more into the forward bend. Doing this will oscillate the torso in an imperceptible manner. Remain in this position for around 20 seconds.
5) To get out of the posture, release the hands. Get your hands to your hips, breathe in and come back up with your back Straightened.

Yoga practices can make us more and more sensitive to subtle sensations in the body. Paying attention to and staying with finer sensations within the body is one of the surest ways to steady the wandering mind. Yoga Arena provides you with the best videos of yoga asanas, pranayam, meditation and many more exercises to bring back the fitness and healthy living for everyone.",Kids exercise,true

I consulted with physical education teachers in developing this new count to 100 song.

This count to 100 song includes some creative and fun new exercises and some physical education positions that are required in PE. I have included cross lateral movements that are so important for body and brain connections and improved brain coordination. Studies have linked increased academic performance to cross lateral movements.    

We are so pleased this count to 100 song has become so popular all over the world. Children seem to love the energy of the music that is great for motivating children to move. I try to do my part and do the song with energy and enthusiasm too.

Exercise is so important for our children. I believe in it, and try to swim, run or bike everyday. I say the numbers very clearly so children can understand and say them with me as we count to 100.

Have fun and keep moving to our Count to 100

24,FPCFrA-Qv0E,Trump Card,[],"A specter is haunting America-the specter of socialism. At first glance, this seems incredible. The twentieth century is seen as the century in which capitalism defeated socialism. Socialist regimes collapsed around the world. Today socialism is confined to failing societies such as Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Yet leading candidates and media figures are enthusiastic about moving America toward socialism. They have a raft of proposals for doing this: Medicare for all, universal basic income, free college, and the Green New Deal. This movie will expose the ideology and tactics of the new socialism. It will explain the temptation of socialism-an age of abundance in which we all get something for nothing-and show why the socialist society is a mirage. Socialism produces deprivation, conformity, and tyranny. More than a critique of socialism, the movie will also make a moral defense of capitalism and show how capitalism, not socialism, is the best way to have prosperity and social justice. Narrated by Dinesh D'Souza and featuring eye-opening interviews, dramatic recreations, and comical animated illustrations, this film will be a timely, riveting, and entertaining look at the biggest issue dividing America today.",Kids exercise,true

ABOUT ME //

I‚Äôm Sarah Aspinall.

I help busy women achieve a healthy and toned body to be proud of using short, high intensity, ballet-inspired workouts daily. 

As a wife and mum of 2 young children, I don‚Äôt have time for long, exhausting workouts, or for pretending to be something I am not.

I specialise in combining ballet technique and fitness to provide you with short workouts that are both achievable and sustainable in the long-term.

In a past life, I was a busy corporate lawyer, working crazy long hours with little time to focus on my health and fitness.

So I left that career, went back to my ballet roots and trained with the Royal Academy of Dance to teach ballet. 

Today my Breaking Ballet business is thriving and I have a huge passion for helping women like me to achieve the healthy body they deserve in a realistic and sustainable way.

I do NOT subscribe to the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù approach. Just ‚Äúdo something‚Äù every day to keep you moving forwards. 

We look forward to welcoming you to Breaking Ballet.

https://lnk.bio/ER6J

Our childhood is where the subconscious mind is formed.

It‚Äôs also where we learn how we process emotions, what relationships look like, how to hold boundaries, and countless other habits and behaviors.

Ideally, our parents are two self actualized people who allow their children to be seen and heard as the unique individual they are. The reality is that we live in a culture that does not teach conscious awareness, so most of us are born to unconscious parents.

Unconscious parents are repeating the same habits and patterns they‚Äôve learned. They‚Äôre operating from a wounded space because of their own unprocessed emotions.
It‚Äôs important to understand that parents can only parent from their own level of awareness.

We can only give others what we have practiced giving ourselves.

I work with mostly Black woman. Over time I‚Äôve come to understand while they seek help for different reasons I can generalized reasons to feeling of low-self worth. Each of these issues manifest differently, but they‚Äôre all tied to one thing: conditioned behavior practiced since childhood. #NOBB #NOBBLIFE

An amazing nine-year-old showed off his incredible hand speed and agility during intense boxing exercises.
 
Little Nikita Kasyanov might look slight, but he hides a stinging secret only revealed when he is throwing punches for training.
 
Whether it‚Äôs using his lightning fast reflexes to duck and dodge a swinging bar while jabbing at the air or landing laser-like hooks on a tennis ball attached to his head, Nikita‚Äôs punches are inch perfect.
 
Nikita, from Moscow, Russia, is so driven to reach his dream of being world champion one day, that he trains five days a week.

‚ÄúYou might think Physical Ed doesn‚Äôt dance. Well, he dances. I‚Äôm his brother Jim Nasium and I made up some special dances just for you and he because I know how he likes to shake his bad self. Follow me.‚Äù 
Put one hand on the top and one hand on the bottom.

Pogo up slow. Pogo up slow. Pogo up fast. Pogo up fast. We‚Äôre gonna pogo up slow. We‚Äôre gonna pogo up quick with our pogo sticks.

Sweep it up slow. Sweep it up slow. Sweep it up fast. Sweep it up fast. We‚Äôre gonna sweep it up slow. We‚Äôre gonna sweep it up quick with our broom sticks.

As Corona Virus is a difficult situation that we are all trying to figure out how to live with, children too. They are spending most of their time at home. This is a beautiful opportunity in many ways for families to connect and enjoy time together. It can also be a challenge as children are full of emotions and have limited resources to deal with the feelings coming up. Through this video I hope kids can try some fun yoga postures, get creative, and release any built up energy or stress. From playing with the letters that spell home, h-o-m-e, to talking about resources we can use when difficult emotions come up, this video is a chance to play and be silly together! The whole family is welcome to join!

Kids are capable of coming up with the most unreal and fantastic creatures in their minds. Shadows are seen as bleak and gloomy, while sunbeams are associated with light and happiness, and can create funny images. What if these fantasies came alive? What if they could jump out of the sunlight?

The Sunny Bunnies are five beaming balls of light that can appear anywhere there is a light source. Whether it is sunlight or moonlight, they bring fun and happiness everywhere they go. However, each time they appear their actions turn into a mischievous game. Sometimes too mischievous.

In each episode, Sunny Bunnies appear at a different location: a circus, a stadium, a carrousel, a park, a stage‚Ä¶ They immediately start to investigate their surroundings and that‚Äôs when the fun and mischief begin! At the very end of every episode, the laughter continues with a collection of bloopers.

It includes some simple breathing exercises and stretches to help kids release tension and calm down when they are feeling stressed, frustrated or anxious.

I suggest that you practice the exercises in this video with your child when they are feeling calm, engaged and ready to learn. When they are familiar with the video you can remind them of their breathing exercises/stretches at times they are experiencing stress and help them learn to calm themselves down.

When our little monkey has his mouth closed, he is breathing in. When his mouth is open, he is breathing out. During stretches, encourage your child to breath deeply and slowly.

It's what lead to my career as a professional athlete! Which is why I am SO excited to share LEANSQUAD‚Äôs first ever KID's WORKOUT in preparation for the #BackToLean Schools Initiative starting next week, September 16th (https://lean-squad.com/blog/backtolean-2019)! 

My goal is to make health and fitness a part of EVERY family, and this workout is the perfect starting point for any parents, kids, students (or anyone for that matter) who is looking to become healthier, fitter and more active!!!

This workout is all body weight and you need no equipment. Likewise, it‚Äôs suitable for kids and adults of ALL ages, and is very low impact. Don‚Äôt let that fool you though, it is still 25 minutes of sweaty, lean fun!!! Similarly, you don‚Äôt need much space at all to get this done. The most important thing is that you just get it done! Taking the first step is often the hardest, but if you get this workout done, you will be well on your way to succeeding on your health and wellness journey. 

Likewise, it is important to remember, that you or your kids should go at your own pace! We are not competing against one another. All that matters is that we do OUR BEST!!! I really think you, your family, or friends are going to LOVE this workout. So make sure you SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel and stay tuned this coming week for a whole lot more sweaty, #BackToLean fun coming your way!!

P.S. Make sure you TAG me on instagram @leansquad if you, your family or kids get this workout done so I can repost! Every time you post about your exercise or food, and tag the leansquad you are inspiring and encouraging someone else to follow in your footsteps!!!

Now let‚Äôs get #BackToLean together!!

These exercises should help. Read Doctor Jo‚Äôs blog post about this video at http://www.askdoctorjo.com/content/balance-coordination

This video will show you balance and coordination exercises while you are moving. So you might want to get near something to hold onto for balance. You can also use your cane if you need to.

The first exercise is going to be like you are walking on a tight rope. We call this tandem gait. You might call it the drunk test. Put one foot right in front of the other. Try to look straight ahead if you can. If that is too difficult, you can put them close together, but not right in front of the other. If this becomes easy to do, then you can move your head from side to side, or even up and down while you are walking.

The next movement is going to be the Grapevine or Crossovers. You will start off going sideways. Take the outside foot and cross it over the other foot. Then step out moving in one direction. Now take the outside foot and go behind the other one. It will almost look like you are braiding your feet. If this becomes easy to do, then you can move your head from side to side, or even up and down while you are walking.

Now you are going to walk up on your toes. Try to stay up the whole time keeping your heels off the ground. Then change it to walking on your heels with your toes in the air. This one is actually a little harder so make sure you have something sturdy to hold onto if needed.

7,6IOyinfQCis,Why Kids with MS May Need to Exercise,"Health,News,Multiple Sclerosis (Disease Or Medical Condition),Physical Exercise (Interest)","http://www.dailyrxnews.com/exercise-children-multiple-sclerosis-may-lead-fewer-brain-lesions

The list of health problems exercise is thought to help with is a long one. And it might have just gotten a bit longer.

A new study found that children with multiple sclerosis (MS) who exercised regularly had fewer brain lesions from the disease.

""Up to three-quarters of children with MS experience depression, tiredness, or memory and thinking impairment,"" said lead study author E. Ann Yeh, MD, associate professor at the University of Toronto and member of the American Academy of Neurology, in a press release. ""Our research is important since little is known regarding how lifestyle behaviors may affect the disease.""

MS is a chronic degenerative disease of the nervous system. In MS, the covering of the nerves is damaged. As a result, patients develop weakness, numbness and visual problems.

The cause is unknown. There is no cure.

Dr. Yeh and colleagues studied 110 children. Thirty-one of these children had been diagnosed with MS.

The children completed surveys about symptoms like tiredness and depression. They also reported how much they exercised.

Only 45 percent of the children with MS reported strenuous exercise.

Children with MS who did report strenuous exercise had fewer brain lesions than those who did not exercise. The lesions, called T2 lesions, are considered a sign of disease activity.

Children with MS who exercised regularly also had fewer relapses compared to those who did not exercise. A relapse occurs when a child who has MS experiences worsening symptoms after a period of improvement.",Kids exercise,true

Cough, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and poor performance occurring five to twenty minutes after strenuous exercise could be signs and symptoms that your child has exercise-induced asthma. Exercise-induced asthma happens when the bronchial tubes undergo constriction and inflammation. This can happen in about 10 percent of athletes.  Up to fifty percent of patients with allergies and in patients with known asthma ninety percent of the time, exercise can be a trigger for asthma symptoms
If your child experiences these signs and symptoms after activity, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, coughing or wheezing minutes into aerobic activity.  These are common in running sports like cross country, soccer, and basketball. They might have exercise-induced asthma. 
Exercise-induced asthma should never limit your child's activities. At Summa, we use a team approach to make the diagnosis involving the athlete, parents, coaches and certified athletic trainers to give you the best outcome.  
Treatments can include preventative measures by covering your mouth and nose during cold air exercises, proper warmup 15 minutes before your event, cool-down exercises, and avoiding air pollutants and allergens. 
Medications can also be used to improve the symptoms.

As these symptoms are minor, one can take appropriate cold related medicines and then put in mild exercise with proper care.
Note that, light or moderate physical activity may help open up the nasal passageway, thus helping us feel better.
But, on the flip side there is a chance of spreading germs or viruses to others.
On the other hand, if the symptoms are below the neck i.e. fever, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, etc. then one should not exercise.

As a Certified Nutritionist, she works with families, companies, and individuals helping them breakthrough the myths around diet and exercise and create a whole new and empowering Culture of Healthy Living.

She has helped thousands of people take back their health through her philosophy Small Change, Big Impact‚Ñ¢.  With this simple, yet profound message, Julie dispels the negative beliefs about weight loss and eradicates the mindset that being healthy is hard.

And she should know.  Up until age 20 Julie battled with her weight.  Her own experience of growing up as the fat girl, and cycling through diet after diet gave her the drive to find a better way. She knows first-hand the heartache, and dangers, of eating junk food, leading a sedentary life and being overweight. 
 
Today, Julie lives a different life. She follows her systematic approach to eating right, exercise and practicing self-care and is committed to helping others do the same.

In her speaking and coaching programs Julie shares her systematic approach to break free from what she describes as the Fat Kid Mentality.   She helps her clients realize and breakthrough all of the limiting beliefs around food and what it really means to be healthy.

Her company, MaxLife Therapies, was inspired by her son Max, whose vibrant health and dynamic nature serve as reminders that nothing is static, and that we all have an inherent desire to create better outcomes for ourselves. It is Julie's strong belief that everyone has the ability to maximize vitality and longevity, and truly Live Your MaxLife‚Ñ¢. 
 
She was recruited to be the Nutritional Coach for the TV documentary, Fitting In which aired on ABC Family in June 2008.   The show, currently being considered for national cable, is designed to educate viewers on the cause, effects and possible solutions for the growing epidemic of childhood obesity.  This is just one example of Julie's commitment to transforming one of our country's leading health issues.

Her educational DVD series Maxs Minutes: The A-Zs of Healthy Living, which she produced with 6-year-old Max, gives parents and kids a fun and unique look at how to create a healthy home.  Her new book, Fat is Not a Four Letter Word: 14 Daily Lessons to Break Through Your Fat Kid Mentality, debuts in 2010 and will transform how people approach dieting and weight loss by giving daily lessons for creating a healthier life.

Whether its personal consultation with adults or working with kids and parents in her MaxLife Family Wellness Programs, Julie implements her winning formula to Educate, Empower, and Explore‚Ñ¢ - a proven step-by-step plan that guarantees results!

Her Corporate MaxLife Wellness Program is the most comprehensive and cost-effective wellness program available.  Companies can effectively support their employees' health goals, while drastically reducing the cost of healthcare and absenteeism due to stress and chronic illness.

Her newest program MaxLife Parents at Work, is specifically designed for busy parents in the workplace.  It takes the principles from her corporate programs, and customizes it to address the challenges that working parents face trying to stay well and raise healthy, happy kids in a busy world. 

Its about creating a CULTURE - so that eating right, exercising and other healthy habits become so much a part of who you are, that you do it without thinking about it!

- And then we have helicopters, bird wings and arm circles and others for arm exercises. 
- On top of that we make time to standing balance with special exercises for that too, so EVERYTHING is included!
And just like all of the videos in this series, you can train as hard as you like, either at a very high intensity and really work up a sweat (like Mr. Ten Thousand) or just get moving and have great fun (like my daughter). It's up to you! Just do your best to make it through the entire workout your own way :)

We also have lots of other fitness videos here on this channel, something for everybody to enjoy and improve their endurance, agility, improve balance, get flexibility and range of motion, get strong and much more. You're most welcome to check out what we share here, all for free :)

Helps reduce the negative effects of sitting for long periods of time, such as rounding of the spine. T-spine and shoulder mobility play a crucial role in your ability to perform well not only on the playing field, but in everyday life. Simple tasks like reaching, picking and lifting things up, and even breathing are affected by poor spinal mobility. The stiffer the spine or more rounded the posture, the less your ribs are able to expand properly. So give this single short stick (4-5ft) drill a try and start moving and breathing better!

------- 

Stick Mobility is a training system that improves your mobility, stability, and strength.

The exercises combine joint mobilization, strength training, and deep fascial stretching to increase athletic performance, reduce the risk of injury, and speed recovery after exercise.

The system uses the Mobility Stick as a simple tool to improve range of motion, muscle activation, coordination, and body awareness to build a strong foundation for better movement. It provides kinesthetic and visual feedback to users and coaches. The Mobility Stick is made with a custom blend of materials designed to achieve the balance of flexibility, strength, and grip needed for the full range of Stick Mobility exercises.

The exercises are based on the scientific principles of:

‚Äì Leverage
‚Äì Stability
‚Äì Feedback
‚Äì Irradiation
‚Äì Isometrics
‚Äì Coordination

Positive Focus is committed to providing physical, emotional and psychological support to all families who are seeking to help their children at a critical time like this. I'll be creating more videos from home this month to help parents and teachers support their children/students with bite-sized practical and positive tools to feel empowered throughout the day. 

In the meantime, take positive actions to develop daily mindful habits! A one-minute conscious break every hour can help children and adults keep calm and carry on in uncertain times.

All exercises in Dyseggxia have been scientifically designed to target reading and writing errors specific for Dyslexic children.

The exercises have been evaluated by a group of users with Dyslexia and are targeted to help improve difficulties caused by Dyslexia. To do so, we have combined current pedagogical strategies with the results of an analysis of real errors made by children.

Dyseggxia is divided into three levels: easy, medium and hard. These have been designed according to word frequency in texts, word length and the number of similar words.

Each level contains several exercises from 5 types:

- Insertion: a letter is missing in a word and must be inserted from the available answers
- Omission: there is an extra letter in the word that must be deleted
- Substitution: there is a wrong letter in the word that must be changed by one of the possible answers
- Derivation: the user is presented with several possible endings to a word and must chose the correct option
- Sentence separation: several words are put together, and the user must identify the breaking points between words

Dyseggxia now includes exercises both in Spanish and English! Easily choose the language you want to play with in the home screen.",Kids exercise,true

FORTNITE DANCE TABATA ((Hip-Hop Version)) by Coach Meger Fitness Tabatas. Great way to mix up elementary pe class with a dance activity to music that allows students to choose a finess activity / dance in a structured high intensity interval workout.


TABATA is a form of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) used by fitness programs ranging from elementary PE to professional athletes. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the program is as follows:

Work out hard for 20 seconds...
Rest for 10 seconds...
REPEAT.
Complete 8 rounds.

You push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise. 

This is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.

Fun fact: legs have the biggest muscles in our body - they are called ""quadriceps"".

This is a very important part of our body, as we use legs everyday to move around. And in today's world, many of us don't move enough and are not active. This leads to weaker legs and weaker muscles.

That's why we need to train our legs everyday in order to get stronger and burn calories.

üìú Message from the composer and creator of Soothing Relaxation:
""I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit whenever you want to sit down and relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Every single day I am completely astonished by all your warm support and it really inspires me to work even harder on my music. If you enjoy my work, I would be very happy if you decided to subscribe and join our community. Have a wonderful day or evening!""

Here we go again!

Faster! Faster! ‚Ä¶ Whoops!

This technique uses a favourite stuffed animal, placed on the belly. 

The goal is to have the child use their belly breathing to lift the stuffed animal on an inhale and lower it on an exhale. This action makes the stuffy appear to swim in the waves of the breath. This technique is extremely effective with pre-school and special needs children.

According to experts, the logic is pretty simple. Whenever we eat food, it is converted into glucose and absorbed into the blood. Hence, when we exercise after having our breakfast, our body uses glucose obtained from the breakfast, instead of fat stored in the fat tissues to produce energy. However, when we exercise before having breakfast, as our body has fasted during sleep, there is less glucose available in the blood to produce energy. Hence, a pre-breakfast exercise forces our body to use more of the fat stored in the fat tissues to produce energy, thus causing us to burn more fat.",Kids exercise,true

On a seaside holiday, four kids from a mixed family visit the beach, where they discover a floppy-eared creature that grants their wishes. But there's a catch: the kids' adventures in rock-climbing, pop stardom, and flying end promptly at sunset-leaving them in danger each time.

When you choose the child free lifestyle you tend to have a bit more wiggle room when it comes to your finances. Today I‚Äôm going to share some of my child free spending habits that happen on a weekly basis. I live in Canada so keep that in mind when you watch as prices for things can be a bit more expensive than in the USA. While choosing the child free life allows for more flexibility in how we spend our money, we still follow a budget.üòä This idea that child free couples just have endless amounts of money isn‚Äôt really realistic for most people. Enjoy watching how a child free woman spends her money. Well, our money. We share!

33,E5-3Ui7oO8U,Kate Compton- Polite Programming Languages: Designing a Generative Language without a PL Degree,[],"This talk is from the 2020 virtual Roguelike Celebration:
https://roguelike.club/event2020.html

Dr Kate Compton (galaxykate) is a long-time generative artist, inventor, and programmer.  She wrote the first paper on procedural platformer levels, generated the planets for Spore, created the language Tracery, and invented an early phone-based AR system. She currently works as an open-source researcher developing the next directions for Tracery and creative chatbots. Her mission is to design artificial intelligence to augment human creativity, and to create tools that brings AI into the hands of poets, artists, kids, and weirdos.

Tracery has been a favorite tool in the Roguelike and generative communities, but it's mostly used for generating text strings.  What if the same principles used to make Tracery were applied to a language for finite state machines? In this talk, Kate describes the common features that her languages share. She also demos an AI agent developed with Nordic ambient musicians as part of their LARP/album, and what it takes to make an agent that can be scripted by musicians and not programmers.

Sesame Street in Communities brings free video content of everyone's favorite, furry Muppet friends as they help children and the adults in their lives reach their highest potential. Grover and the gang will tackle a variety of topics that face children in the areas of health and well-being, school readiness, and emotional well-being. Some of the content and topics presented are more sensitive, so you should preview these videos before sharing with a child. For free resources and tips, follow us at http://www.facebook.com/SesameStreetI... or visit us at https://SesameStreetinCommunities.org
 
Sesame Street is a production of Sesame Workshop, a nonprofit educational organization. The Workshop produces Sesame Street programs, seen in over 150 countries, and other acclaimed shows, including The Electric Company. Beyond television, the Workshop produces content for multiple media platforms on a wide range of issues including literacy and numeracy, emotional well-being, health and wellness, and respect and understanding.

It's also great to perform anytime you or your little ones need to take a short time out to calm down. This routine is all about deep breathing and is a great way to open up the spine and stretch the torso. 

In this video I have tried to represent breathing in a new way by adding a blue ball in the bottom left hand corner. As the ball gets bigger, breathe in, as the ball gets smaller, breathe out. I hope it helps! As always, children will be able to grasp the movements and breathing patterns quicker if you perform the exercises with them. These exercises are excellent for adults as well!

This is currently my favourite breathing routine, I hope you and your little people enjoy it just as much!",Kids exercise,false

My new co-instructor is Lynsey who is a toe-walker.  I start with a general discussion of toe walking.  I show normal ankle movement with a neurotypical child. Then you follow me as I assess a 6-year-old toe walker and follow-up with the treatment ideas that I would suggest. I appreciate so much Lynsey and her family being brave enough to be filmed to help people around the world. I hope you find this information helpful to guide you in assessment, treatment, home programming, and telehealth for children who toe walk. This should be considered only basic information about toe walking. There are people who teach toe walking in workshops for therapists. This presentation of information is not on that level. This discussion is geared toward parents on a more basic level.

TECHNIQUE WAVING THE EVNIK SIMULATOR SIMULATOR:
* Do not rush to disperse the simulator. Follow the correct amplitude, which should reach 40-50 centimeters.
* At the beginning of training, do not allow work due to the wrist joint, the movement occurs either from the elbow joint or from the shoulder joint.

This is an important stage in getting to know the Evnik simulator. Here you need to carefully monitor the work of the child so that he does not make technical errors.


HOW TO PROPERLY KEEP THE SIMULATOR:
* The simulator is held in the middle of the handle.
* Wrist fixed.
* Movement comes either from the shoulder joint or from the elbow joint. (Envy of exercise)

These rules are very important for the proper operation of the simulator and immediate load. The omission of any stage is a loss of efficiency and quality of work.

Start your workouts correctly and the results will not keep you waiting !!!

Make Straight and Curved Lines

I'm so excited to get ready to write
Let's learn how to do it one line at a time
Get your body ready and really try
Let's practice making straight lines
Make a straight line top to bottom
Make a straight line top to bottom
Make a straight line across
Make a straight line across
Now, make a slanted line
Now, make a slanted line
Make a slanted line in the other direction
Make a slanted line like this
I'm so excited to get ready to write
Let's learn how to do it one line at a time
Get your body ready and really try
Let's practice making straight and curved lines
Make a curved line like this
Make a curved line like this
Now, make a curved line like this
Now, make a curved line like this
Make a curved line like this
Make a curved line like this
Now, make a curved line like this
Now, make a curved line like this
Make a curved line all the way around
Make a curved line all the way around
I'm so excited to get ready to write
We learned how to do it one line at a time
Keep on practicing and really try
And soon you'll be ready to write
Good job!

The Flip or Flop star made the announcement via Instagram, writing: 

""Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate. We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.""

It seems her husband hasn't had the easiest time with the seemingly sudden dissolution of their union. According to People, the British TV host enrolled himself in a breakup recovery program for help coping with the split. The good news is it seems Ant Anstead's work with Create the Love has worked, as he shared on Instagram: 

""I am now on day 30 of this and I have to say it's been a lifeline for me! If anyone out there needs this DO IT!""

According to House Beautiful, the program's leader, Mark Groves, who calls himself a ""Human Connection Specialist"" on Instagram, will coach followers through the process of grieving and letting go of love through emails, videos, and exercises. The newly single dad also committed to a faith-based program, Rise Up Kings, to help him find peace with his relationship ending. He chronicled the experience on social media.

On September 26, Anstead shared his feelings about the breakup on Instagram, writing alongside a throwback photo of the couple: 

""Anyone who really knows me knows that I don't like to share private matters publicly. I have remained silent while holding on to hope. I never gave up on us. I pray Christina's decision brings her happiness.""

Mahatria highlights the importance of striking a balance and stepping up to take responsibility as parents. We must never let our children beg for anything. At the same time, we must not deprive them of striving for their aspirations. Only then they will value what they gain!
Using an example from His own life, Mahatria illustrates the values of hard work and appreciation that children must imbibe. If you start shielding the lack of process in them, you destroy them and their aspirations in life. Children must be appreciated for their striving and efforts, while simultaneously notified of their lack of hard work in any particular field. Mahatria signs off by saying that it is every parent's responsibility to keep reminding them whenever their striving is missing.

How to conquer emotional eating habits. Emotional eating habits are unhealthy for your body, but you have the power to change your bad food habits!

Emotional eating is something that so many people deal with, including myself. In order to conquer emotional eating or binge eating disorder, we need to talk about it and understand why people tend to develop unhealthy eating habits.

In today‚Äôs video I talk to you about the triggers that cause me to emotionally eat and how I overcome that urge. I‚Äôd like to help you to stop yourself from emotional eating, and I think this video is a good first step!

What happens to your body when you drink a gallon of water a day? There are several benefits to drinking gallons of water everyday. TO begin, by drinking a lot of water daily means you‚Äôll be drinking a lot less of the bad stuff (sugary juices, fancy lattes etc.). 

Drinking the correct amount of water everyday will help your body regulate. There may be some debate as to how much water you should be drinking daily, but a gallon of water a day will work for a lot of people.

Staying well hydrated and drinking your water is a huge factor in losing weight, and it‚Äôs one of the most important things you can do on a Code Red Lifestyle.

I have found 2 new co-instructors to help me teach balance. Please welcome Louisa and Luca! They are brother and sister. Louisa is 9 years old, and Luca is 4 years old. Both of these kids are typically developing. I actually suspect they are advanced in their movement skills. I start with the simplest ideas and work in later videos to more and more challenging ideas. I provide balance ideas for standing on 2 feet or standing on one. I'd like to thank this family for allowing me to come to their home to video. I'd like to thank Luca and Louisa for giving up some of their play time to help.

Instruction.

Encouragement.

Correction.

Praise.

Damone responds well to all of it during a special workout with the Queen Creek High School boys‚Äô basketball team and head coach Daniel Bobik.

Damone is a multi-sport athlete who thrives in the world of competition, says John Hicks, a child specific adoption recruiter with Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK).

‚ÄúHe enjoys the routine and structure that sports gives him,‚Äù says Hicks, adding that sports gives the eighth-grader the motivation to do well in school.
Damone runs track and plays football, but his favorite sport is basketball.

‚ÄúWhat I like about basketball is jumping and moving around,‚Äù the soft-spoken Damone says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really good at dribbling.‚Äù
But, he knows he can get better.
‚ÄúI like people coaching me,‚Äù Damone says. ‚ÄúI like getting coached.‚Äù
When he isn‚Äôt playing sports, Damone says he likes to get lost in a book.
‚ÄúI like reading books, especially the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books,‚Äù he says.
The perfect forever family for Damone would include a mother and a father to serve as a strong male role model.
‚ÄúLike any athlete,‚Äù Hicks says. ‚ÄúDamone needs a good coach and a good cheerleader.‚Äù

For more information on children eligible for adoption, call Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK) at 602-930-4900, or visit www.aask-az.org

Summary:
1. Avocado
Avocados and healthy eating go hand in hand. You can put them in your salad, sandwich or use it as a dip. This fruit, yes fruit, is packed with several of the brain's most valuable nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E and copper. Having it fresh each day will improve your problem solving skills and memory.

2. Blueberries
Blueberries make everything better! From smoothies to chocolates, Blueberries have been around for a long time. Not only are these tiny berries delicious, they‚Äôre packed with brain boosting nutrients as well! Scientists have found they have the capacity to increase brain activity, boost blood flow and improve your memory.

3. Turmeric
This ancient Indian herb‚Äôs medical usage dates back centuries. Turmeric not only gives curry its yellow color, it‚Äôs loaded with compounds and minerals that have anti inflammatory properties along with being one of the best foods for the brain. The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has a high concentration of antioxidants that boosts brain power and keeps cells healthy. 

4. Fatty Fish
When was the last time you had fish for dinner? When we talk about Brain boosting foods, fatty fish tops the list. Fishes like trout, salmon and sardines fall under this category. What makes them special is the natural presence of essential Omega 3 fatty acids along with good fats. This combination helps in keeping your brain and heart healthy.

5. Nuts And Seeds
If you haven‚Äôt already added nuts and seeds to your meals then it is time for you to do so. Walnuts, almonds, peanuts, pecans and pistachios are filled with good fats, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. These help in preventing age related disease in the brain, protecting the cells and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

A boy, who at the ripe age of 5, was told that he was going to the NBA. He had the weight of the world on his shoulders given that his three older brothers (who were elite basketball players in college) never made pro. For Stephon, there was no choice, but to redeem his family name and build a global legacy in the sport of basketball, but not without its downfalls.

47,fJGLSlZvk5E,Some Jewish Rockland Schools in Red Zone Appear to be Violating Governor's Orders,[],"Schools in Rockland County red zones appear to be violating the Gov. Andrew Cuomo's orders.

Threats to withhold funding are not stopping at least three yeshivas from welcoming students Thursday.

Yeshiva was in session Thursday at three schools in Monsey and Spring Valley ‚Äì right in the middle of Rockland's red zone.

News 12 followed a bus that seemed to be picking up children. In the short time News 12 followed the bus, it picked up half a dozen kids, if not more.

This comes in spite of Gov. Cuomo threatening to pull funding from localities and school, which he underlined again Thursday in a press call.

Three Jewish congregations in Rockland filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the governor and the state, calling the restrictions unconstitutional and saying the actions violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

Jewish leaders say case numbers are high because more people in these neighborhoods are getting tested, while blasting Gov. Cuomo for breaking his declaration to only close schools when the regional average hit 9%, not a neighborhood.

Despite continuous violations, numbers have dropped since restrictions went into effect - a possible sign closures are working.",Kids exercise,true

After Lewis petitioned Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to help integrate a segregated school in his hometown of Troy, Alabama, King sent ""the boy from Troy"" a round trip bus ticket to meet with him. From that meeting onward, Lewis became one of King's closest allies. He organized Freedom Rides that left him bloodied or jailed, and stood at the front lines in the historic marches on Washington and Selma. He never lost the spirit of the ""boy from Troy"" and called on his fellow Americans to get into ""good trouble"" until his passing on July 17, 2020.",Kids exercise,true

Both Parents and Children are already looking forward to coming saturday morning session.
