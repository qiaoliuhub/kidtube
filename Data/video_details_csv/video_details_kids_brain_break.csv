Some of these tricky optical illusion games will break your mind! Try to focus on solving them and don't let anything bother you. These tricky brain games and puzzles will not just warm up your brain but also exercise it well.

00:14 - Can you read what's written in here? It's a cool way to test your brain!  If you can see these words and sentences clearly then probably you have a well-trained brain.
02:03 - Let's see how attentive you are! Find cute pandas in these pictures and try to do it as quick as possible.
03:51 - Can you tell for sure if it's the same photo?! Take your time and try to find differences between these pictures!
05:14 - Hard riddles that adults fail, but kids crack without any effort! Well, some kids do fail, but not many of them. To crack these tricky riddles for kids, you'll need to distance yourself from the picture and let your eyes just wander around and suddenly you'll start to see the hidden words everywhere 😮 
07:20 - Amazing optical illusion riddles and brain games to test your vision and brain as well! If your brain elastic (as it should be) then you will easily read all of them, however, if your brain is not stretched, then you should add up more into your brain exercises routine! 😎
09:32 - Can you guess right if these are real or fake? Sometimes it's almost impossible to find the right answer. These optical illusions will immediately blow your mind! 
11:16 - Put on your glasses and try to see who is hiding here! Only those with perfect vision will crack these optical illusion puzzles and will be to tell us who is hidden in the last illusion picture 🤓 

TELL me IN THE COMMENTS which optical illusion made you stuck in front of the screen for quite a time!

Dancing Star can be compared to the hugely popular Cha Cha Slide. Children follow directions and move together.

You can use brain breaks to start your day, anytime children need a positive physical activity, after lunch or for indoor recess on days with bad weather.

When I perform any of my brain breaks songs in concert, children love it. Dancing Star is no exception.

My brain breaks songs can be used in physical education classes too. Teachers love how the children have to stop and put their hands to their ears to listen carefully. This is a great song to teach children about following directions.
Dancing Star Words and Music by Jack Hartmann, copyright 2011 Jack Hartmann www.jackhartmann.com 

LYRICS:

Dancing Star
 
Watch me, watch me I can raise the roof 
Watch me, watch me I can shake it loose  Chorus 
Shake it down then jump it up so far
I can shine like a dancing star 
 
Let’s get loose and warm it up 
All together, step to the front
 Jump to the back and clap 
Raise your arms up in the air 
Back and forth like you just don’t care
 Right leg stomp to the left
 Left leg stomp to the right 
One arm up shake your hips 
I can disco just like this Now stop and pose 
Be cool, slide to the right 
Be cool, slide to the left Jump up and count 
 
Robo dance, move it, block it like a robot You got it 
 
(Chorus) 
 
 
Now everybody square it up 
Step to the back, slide to the right 
Step to the front, slide to the left 
Now cabbage patch, arms circle around, be cool get down
 Country dance, stomp and clap 
Now turn around, clap like this 
Turn around again, clap like this 
Right leg stomp to the left, left leg stomp to the right 
Now jump up, criss-cross, criss-cross 
Shake your shoulders, shake your hips 
Shake it like a salt shaker, like this
 Now turn around, clap like this 
Turn around again, clap like this 
your own dance, dance free
 Now freeze Let’s cool it down, do the sprinkler 
Take it down, that was fun, we’re done

HARRY KINDERGARTEN MUSIC FREEBIES:
This song is a FREEBIE. You can stream it for free on YouTube, but also buy it at my website. I am already offering 60+ of my hip educational songs/videos on YouTube FOR FREE at youtube.com/harrykindergarten. Enjoy them, utilize them, and share them! I am a current full-time Kindergarten teacher so I know what it's like to be looking around for quality content in my classroom! You can ALSO purchase the raw video file and/or audio file of those 60+ songs at my website (if you need them for some reason) or at Teachers Pay Teachers. I will continue to make freebie videos (ones you can just stream on YouTube for free) periodically, so continue to check back to see if I've posted any. 

*Please DO NOT rip any of my videos off of YouTube and upload them to your YouTube channel. I want the Harry Kindergarten Music channel to be the hotspot for these videos, not random teachers' channels who happened to illegally take them off of mine. If you really want to have a playlist of them, create a playlist from MY channel or purchase them on my website so you have the raw files. THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING!

Q: Do you speak at conferences?
A: Yes! My ability to speak at teacher conferences during the school year is ""tight"" because I am currently a classroom teacher and only have a set number of personal days. However, the SUMMER time is wide-open and I'd love to come to your conference and do a session/seminar! Some of the topics I've typically spoken to teachers about include music and technology in the classroom, classroom management, running a creative morning meeting, and utilizing YouTube in the early childhood classroom. Email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com to make a speaking request.

Q: Can my class perform a ""Harry Kindergarten song"" for an audience?
A: If you desire to have your class or group of students perform one of my “Harry Kindergarten” songs for an audience, please note that there is a $6.00 PERFORMANCE FEE.

Here are some hypothetical examples of performance groups:
* Students perform a song for an audience during a graduation ceremony.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school or community talent show.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school assembly.
If you are unsure if you need to purchase a performance license or not, please inquire at: pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com. If you want more details about using a song multiple years or multiple classes, etc., e-mail me for a detailed PDF file.

This brain breaks song also teaches children some basic spatial concepts (front, back, side to side and right and left and number awareness).

Classroom teachers and physical education teachers can do with children quickly and easily everyday. 

It engages children with extended arm circle moves and full body stretching and counting out loud. It also includes some basic subtraction as each time we stretch all around one number is taken away.  The repetition of this in the song makes it so simple and easy to follow.

Children can really get some exercise participating in all the moves in this song. It's a good workout song and the children will have fun moving together. It also builds endurance as this song really gets you moving for several minutes continually.

I just love the beat with some cool pop country music makes you want to do it too.

All these skills are very important developmental skills for young children. 

This pirate song for kids continues to be one of my most popular original songs. Children really use their imaginations as they act out each character's part. This movement on this children's pirate song is super fun.

Teachers and Parents can extend the learning after the video by asking these questions. 

Who is your favorite character?

Can you tell me what order the characters appear in?

How many characters did you see?

The simple rhythm and great melody of Silly Pirate Song continues to make this pirate song for kids a favorite of children around the world.

It’s a great brain breaks activity to get kids singing, moving and hearing the fun rhyming and language play of flip – flop, wig – wag & zig – zag.  

All young kids love singing this catch phrase and follow in the fun movements I do on the video.  Rags is just fantastic for developing rhyming awareness, listening skills and gross motor movement.

Rags is like a super fun nursery rhyme with lots of movement.  I sing this song “live” at many of my concerts and it’s always a great favorite to get everybody moving, smiling and singing.  

Rags is simply a wonderful brain breaks song, a rhyming awareness and language play song and just a fun movement song everyone enjoys.

Lyrics
I've got a dog and his name is Rags
He eats so much that his tummy sags
His ears flip-flog and his tail wig wags
And when he walks he walks zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
I love Rags and he loves me

My dog Rags he loves to play
He rolls around in the mud all day
I call him, he doesn't obey
He always runs the other way
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
I love Rags and he loves me

He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag
I love Rags and he loves me
I love Rags and he loves me
He goes flip -flop, wig-wag, zig-zag

Watch top left corner for a link to the lyrics around 42 seconds. Or, use this link: http://drjean.org/html/youTube.html. If you check the lyrics, you will soon learn whether it is form or farm. 

All of Dr. Jean's music is available on iTunes. This song is on the CD set Better Bodies and Brains.The song is available on iTunes and Amazon.

You learn on your feet, not on your seat! When children move, dance, and wiggle, more senses are activated and the message is more likely to get to the brain. Music and movement also emit endorphins which make you happy. These activities are great for cardio, eye-hand coordination, flexibility, strength, and children's BRAINS! Children will also develop body spatial awareness, cooperation, self-control, social skills, and they will learn to listen and follow directions. It feels good to feel good, and when children feel good their behavior improves! See more at drjean.org

Here are the top ten reasons to SING every day!

1. When you sing your brain emits endorphins, and endorphins make you happy!  Emotions are critical to learning.

2. Music is multi-sensory.  The more senses you get going to the brain, the more likely the message will get there.

3. Music is powerful for prior-learning.  If children are exposed to concepts while singing, it is easier for them to learn when formally introduced.

4. Music nurtures phonemic awareness (alliteration, rhyme, etc.).

5. Songs and chants are a natural way to develop oral language and auditory memory.

6. Poems and songs lay a foundation for fluency and enhance short term memory.

7. Children are able to use their imaginations and create pictures in their brains when they sing.  This is an important part of reading comprehension.

 8. Repetition is a key to learning.  It is much more fun to repeat songs than worksheets!

 9. Singing and dancing relieve stress and oxygenate the brain.

10. Through music and movement ALL children can feel successful.  A “community of learners” is enhanced when teachers and children enjoy something together!

There was a study that was reported on National Public Radio called “Alive Inside.”  In the research study they made iPods of songs that had a special significance to patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s.  These patients didn’t recognize family members, but when they heard the music they tapped their feet, sang the words, and smiled!  So many things that we do in our classrooms will be forgotten, but the songs will be stored in children’s brains for a lifetime!  What a privilege to be able to do this!",Kids brain break,false

»»-------------¤-------------««»»-------------¤-------------««

Q. What is a fraction?
A. A fraction has a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number).  The numerator is how many parts (cookies, slices, things etc.) we have, while the denominator represents how many times those parts are being divided/shared.

Q. What grade levels does our Fractions Song For Kids target?
A. 2nd Grade - 3rd Grade.

Q. Where did you guys come from?
A. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  

Q. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?
A. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  

During testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.

Q. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?

We have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  

Coming Soon:
1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.

2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  

Research has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.

Hope to see you at https://numberock.com!

This fractions video is aligned with the following Common Core and TEKS standards:

Common Core Standards
3.NF.A.1 | 3.NF.1
Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.
3.NF.A.2 | 3.NF.2
Understand a fraction as a number on the number line; represent fractions on a number line diagram.

TEKS Standards
2.3B 
The student is expected to explain that the more fractional parts used to make a whole, the smaller the part; and the fewer the fractional parts, the larger the part.
3.3A
The student is expected to represent fractions greater than zero and less than or equal to one with denominators of 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 using concrete objects and pictorial models, including strip diagrams and number lines.",Kids brain break,true

LYRICS:
Albuquerque is a turkey
And he's feathered and he's fine
And he wobbles and he gobbles
And he's absolutely mine.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
And he wobbles and he gobbles,
And he’s absolutely mine.

He's the best pet that you can get...
Better than a dog or cat.
He's my Albuquerque turkey
And I'm awfully proud of that.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
He’s my Albuquerque turkey,
and I’m awfully proud of that.
He once told me, very frankly
He preferred to be my pet,
Not the main course at my dinner,
And I told him not to fret.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
Not the main course at my dinner,                                                                                                                                                 And I told him not to fret.

Now my Albuquerque turkey
Is so happy in his bed,
'Cause for our Thanksgiving dinner...
We had mac and cheese instead.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
‘Cause for our Thanksgiving dinner,
We had mac and cheese instead.
We had mac and cheese instead.                                                                                                                                                 We had mac and cheese instead.

What/Who is NUMBEROCK?

We make animated math videos and educational songs for kids that bring joy back into math class and make it cool again!  Up until today, we have created nearly 30 animated music videos that cover mathematical concepts for 3rd Grade, 4th Grade, and 5th Grade; concepts like, Rounding Numbers, Ordering Decimals, Subtraction, 3D Shapes, Types of Angles and much more!  

We're curious to see how our teaching resource will be used now that we have shared them with a broader audience.  Thanks for your interest.

How did NUMBEROCK begin?

When you look at the entertainment that’s being
produced for kids in games and movies, it’s no wonder
that kids are starting to zone out in school. 

During the last 7 years as an elementary public school teacher, I’ve
always tried to find new ways to capture my students’
full attention, especially for that one subject that gets
such a notoriously bad rap in elementary school – math.

One day I brought my guitar in to school to play a song
I’d written about Long Division that was accompanied
by some simple animations I’d made. While not all my
students liked the folk rock genre, I could tell I had everyone’s attention.

Soon I began writing songs in genres that my students
actually listened to: rap, rock, pop, country, you name
it. Parents would tell me that their kids were singing the
songs in the car, at dinner, even teaching them to their
siblings. Almost in disbelief that kids were singing my
math songs for fun outside of school, I felt encouraged
and inspired to keep writing. Then, three years ago, I
had one of those ‘AHA!’ moments: to write a song with a
simple animation for every math concept I had to teach.

Altogether, from 2008 to now, I’ve written songs for
nearly 50 concepts, 30 of which are now professionally
animated. Lesson materials to help maximize learning
for those 30 songs are available at ""Teachers Pay Teachers"", 
a website where teachers, homeschoolers, and parents can buy high quality learning materials. 

I hope your student(s) will find a renewed passion for math as
they access the NUMBEROCK method.",Kids brain break,true

Lyrics
Everybody up, nobody sit
This is number zero and it looks like this
Everybody move, nobody quit

Move your body make a zero just like this
Start at the top, curve around
No straight lines go all the way around
Start at the top, curve around
No straight lines go all the way around
Zero, zero, this is number zero

Zero is a placeholder so you know
If the number is tens, hundreds or more

Three jet planes are flying in the sky
Fly, fly, flying in the sky
They all flew down and landed on the ground
How many jet planes are flying now?
Zero, zero not  1
That's what zero means, none 

Five horses are galloping on the track
Gallop, gallop, galloping on the track
They finish the race and all lay down
How many horses are galloping now?
Zero, zero not  1
That's what zero means, none 

Zero, zero, this is number zero
Zero, zero, zero is our hero

Two penguins are waddling on the ice
Waddle, waddle, waddling on the ice
They dove in the water with a funny sound 
How many penguins are waddling now?
Zero, zero not  1
That's what zero means, none 

One truck is rolling down the road
Roll, roll, rolling down the road
It stopped at the store and the engine cooled down
How many trucks are rolling now?
Zero, zero not  1
That's what zero means, none 

Zero is a placeholder so you know
If the number is tens, hundreds or more
Zero, zero, zero is our hero
Zero is a number that helps us out
So learn about zero to help you count
Zero is cool 
Zero is a number don't forget
Add zero to a number that's the number you get
Zero, oh yeah

Subtract zero from a number that's the number you get

You have hit a plateau. A plateau in learning occurs when you keep working at learning, but you can't seem to get better at the language.

This occurs because your mind adapts to the things you are doing. The routines you have developed to learn English have become routine and you are used to them. You need to change things up a bit.

In this English lesson I will help you understand what a learning plateau is, and I'll give you 5 important strategies that you can use to break through the English learning plateau!

⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!

A great song for a brain break in the classroom or at home. 

Song Lyrics

If a kangaroo can jump then you can too

Verse 1

Follow me along
See if you can do
All the sounds and movements 
That you might see in a zoo
You might be surprised
At how easy it can be
To imitate the animals
In this menagerie


Chorus

Soar as high as an eagle
Squawk like an Aussie cockatoo
Hang out like a sloth
Or waddle like a duck
If a kangaroo can jump then you can too


Verse 2

It’s not very hard
To copy what you see
To hop and stomp and crawl or swim 
Like creatures in the sea
Or talk to the animals
With a ‘woof’ or ‘quack’ or ‘moo’
Or growl and roar at dinner time
Like lions in the zoo

Chorus

Swing and scratch like a monkey
Snort and prance like gnu
Gallop like a zebra
Or slink like a fox
If a kangaroo can jump then you can too

If a kangaroo can jump then you can too!

I had so much fun creating this fun, good morning/welcome song to help kids learn! And a bonus...it’s also a great call and response song.

Let me know what you and your students think!

LYRICS:
I’ve got the feeling that today is a special day and we need to CELEBRATE!

Now it’s time to celebrate, to celebrate
Now it’s time to celebrate, to celebrate

Y’all, that is so great, let's not wait let's celebrate
Undulate, move your vertebrate
Party activate! Be a good time advocate!
Move your body as we celebrate and...
Animate, congregate, culminate, demonstrate
Dance on down to the Bering Strait
But there’s one thing left to extrapolate
so come on party people let me hear you say it!

WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?
(shout it out loud)
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

(That’s right!)
Now it’s time to celebrate, to celebrate
(Woo, it feels good to celebrate!)
Now it’s time to celebrate, to celebrate

Don't premeditate or procrastinate, 
Let's appreciate, let's celebrate
Undulate, move your vertebrates
Strut the runway like a fashion plate

Let’s see…
Navigate, percolate, propagate, save the date,
Syncopate, tabulate, tolerate, celebrate!

Educate, elevate, instigate, motivate, 
Today’s the date to celebrate, it feels so great to ask y’all…
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?
(shout it out loud)
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

Go Class! Go Class! Go Class! 
Go Class! Go Class! Go Class! 

Oh yeah! You are celebrating with Blazer Fresh! Get up out of your seats and dance with us! Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate!

WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

Mr. B's Brain shows that sounding out words is systematic: stretch the word slowly, break it into its component chunks, listen closely for the vowel sound, and finally write what you hear.

For most children, some time around preschool, kindergarten, or first grade they start to see words not as whole units, but small chunks that come together to form words.   Sure worksheet practice is part of the process, but our video will bring another part to that: fun visuals and examples to help children see the pattern to spelling.  That way they will be ready for the spelling test!  We use fun, fancy clipart to bring together our electronic program.  It's for the beginner, early primary grade spellers, typically a 6 year old or under.  And remember, early spelling is not always about being correct, but listening for the acceptable sounds they hear (e.g. ""bat"" might be ""bt"" ""bet"" or even just ""b"").  The words you select should be a challenge level of medium without frustration, and practice throughout the week as you would any skill you want to improve.  If the child is having trouble hearing sounds in words, switch to a visual style as that might be a stronger way of processing for that particular kid.

Our goal at Mr. B's Brain is to use YouTube as an enrichment for school.  We aim to help each student with animated learning opportunities.  We have gotten feedback that our lessons are effective for the toddler all the way to the adult - as it helps moms and dads learn how to teach their students in better ways.  We've done a patient search of video Youtube content, surveyed teachers, looked at what was effective in the classroom, analyzed lesson plans, and then came to create what you see before you.  We are proud of our free high resolution short videos that are a great tool to join with a traditional education.  You have our permission to use them in your home, preschool, kindergarten class, first grade classroom, or anywhere else you'd like to.  Thanks for your support, enjoy!

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

★ Lyrics
We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A ghostly, ghoulish goblin waving cheerfully. 
He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A very vain vampire waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.

____________________________

BACKSTORY: Tired of the traditional Brain Break songs available, my daughter Avery and I set out to create some fun new brain breaks to popular songs that not only get your body moving, but also serve as opportunities for connection and eye contact with peers and adults to help support healthy relationships. These work great as part of a Conscious Discipline ""Brain Smart Start"" in how they incorporate opportunities to 1- Unite (everyone doing the same actions) 2- Disengage Stress (deep breathing), 3- Connect (hugs and eye contact).  So enjoy the break and have fun connecting with those you love both at school and at home!

I like to sing this song with an accelerando to help students get all of their silly energy out. After clapping, stomping, and patting, you can come up with any type of movement you would like to do. You can even allow students to come up with their own movement or pose. Use this time to help students stretch and gain focus while also acting silly.

Children everywhere love Tooty ta!

Hip-Hop Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student’s attention, get a mental and physical break from their academics  enabling them to have a better focus for learning.  Using my cool 
Hip-Hop Tooty-Ta as a “brain break” is a win-win situation. Students learn during these “brain breaks” plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My Hip-Hop Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.

Check out some of our Hip-Hop dance moves which are ideal for crossing the mid-line.  It’s also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

'WE'RE GOING ON A BEAR HUNT SONG LYRICS':

We're going on a bear hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Oh, Look at that tall wavy grass
It's so tall

Can't go over it X2
Can't go under it X2
Just going to have to go through it X2
swish swish swish 

We're going on a bear hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, there's a big river
Can't go over it X2 
Can't go under it X2 
Going to have to swim it X2
splash splash splash 

We're going on a bear hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Ugh, look at all that mud
so muddy
Can't go over it X2
Can't go under it X2
Going to have to go through it
squish squish squish 

We're going on a bear hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, what's that
It's a cave
We can't go over it
We can't go under it
Going to have to go into it
step step step 

We're going on a bear hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared 
I'm a little scared

Sure is dark in here
What's that in the corner
I feel 2 big ears X 2
I feel 1 wet nose X 2
I feel 2 sharp teeth X2 
I know what that is
It's a bear

Let's get out of here

Let's run out of the cave
step step step 

Quickly back through the mud
squish squish squish

Let's cross the river
splash splash splash 

Through the tall grass
swish swish swish


Through the yard, up the stairs, into the house, close the door

We're safe

That's a close one

Let's not go bear hunting anymore!

Angry Song  (This emotions song for children teaches them how to deal with anger.)
From the CD, “Singing, Moving and Fun” 
by The Learning Station  (a.k.a. Learning Station) and sung by Don Monopoli                                                             
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 

When I ask my friends to play and they say, “No, just go away.” I’m angry. I feel so angry. 
When I’m standing in a line and someone pushes from behind. I’m angry. I feel so angry. 

It’s okay if you get mad. It’s just because you’re feeling bad. It’s alright to feel that way. 
Just use words and you should say, “I’m angry. I feel so angry.” 

When I’m having lots of fun and Daddy tells me, “ Clean up son. “ I’m angry. I feel so angry. 
Kids tease me and call me “squirt”. My feelings really do get hurt. I’m angry. I feel so angry.
When I build my blocks so high and someone knocks them down, I cry. I’m angry. I feel so angry. 

Cooperation is the way to make the angries go away. So talk, don’t shout. Just work it out, and it’s okay of you should say, “I’m angry. I feel so angry.” “I’m angry. I feel so angry.” “I’m angry. I feel so angry.”
“I’m angry. I feel so angry.” “I’m angry. I feel so angry.” “I’m angry. I feel so angry.” “I’m angry.”

This song really makes rhyming fun which is so important in learning for young children. The ability to know when words rhyme is an essential listening and language skill for all children.  Many studies have shown that children who have developed their ability to know when words rhyme will have a better chance of becoming successful readers. Offering your children many opportunities to hear and practice rhyming will give them a better chance of becoming lifelong readers.
Make a Rhyme, Make a Move is a great song to use regularly to allow your children to really have   fun learning about rhyming.  This song presents two words, and children have a chance to listen and decide if the words rhyme or not. If the words rhyme then they do a cool Hip –Hop dance, and if the words don’t rhyme they get a chance to move and say - No way, no way.
 Listening for the parts of sounds in words at the beginning, middle and ending really helps children develop their phonological awareness (hearing the parts of words) skills so important in becoming a successful reader.
This song is so cool it will really help make learning about rhyming fun for all your children.
 Make a Rhyme, Make a Move includes Jack Hartmann and Rachel Smith singing together. Both Rachel and Jack show your children the different moves and dances they can do. And, this rhyming song features rhyming that is simple and easy to follow.
Studies show that having the ability to recognize and be aware of words that rhyme is a good predictor of future successful reading in the future.
Help make rhyming fun for your children and sing, dance and listen for those rhymes!

Lyrics:

Make a rhyme, make a move 
You can do it 
 I can too 
Let's go! 

Make a rhyme, make a move
Do it to the beat
Make a rhyme, make a move 
Have some fun with me  

When the two words rhyme make a move like this 
Two thumbs up, crisscross
Say that rhymes
That rhymes 
When the words don’t rhyme
Make a move like this 
One arm out front, back and forth 
Say no way
No way  
You got it

Lyrics
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Reach both hands high,  sway them side to side
Crossover, crossover to the left and right
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

Put your hands in fists, roll them side to side
Crossover, crossover to the left and right
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

Spread your feet to the sides, get set to jump high
Crisscross, crisscross to the left and right
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

Move it like Humpty Dumpty dancing on the wall
Twisting and turning please Humpty don't fall
Move it like a chicken shaking his wings and knees
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

Move your arms out straight, swing your hips side to side
Switcharoo, switcharoo floss dance left and right
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

I like to move it with my hands and move it with my feet
I like to move it with my friends feel so good and so free
Move it down low, move it up high
I like to crisscross, crisscross left and right
Move it, move it , move it and freeze
Move it, move it , move it and freeze

FIVE LITTLE MONKEYS
From  the CD, Tony Chestnut & Fun Time Action Songs
By The Learning Station
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics:

Five little monkeys jumping on the bed.
One fell off and bumped his head.
Called the doctor and the doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

Four little monkeys jumping on the bed.
One fell off and bumped his head.
Called the doctor and the doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

Three little monkeys jumping on the bed.
One fell off and bumped his head.
Called the doctor and the doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

Two little monkeys jumping on the bed.
One fell off and bumped his head.
Called the doctor and the doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

One little monkey jumping on the bed.
One fell off and bumped his head.
Called the doctor and the doctor said,
""No more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

Now there's no little monkeys jumping on the bed.
None fell off and bumped their heads.
I called the doctor and the doctor said,
""Ain't no more monkeys jumping on the bed.""

LYRICS:
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Stand up tall, find a friend, and stick out your right hand.
Firmly shake and look them in the eye...
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What's up? It's a great day. 
I'm thankful to be with you.
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What's up? 
I'm happy to (feel this way).- 3x
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Close your hand with your knuckles facing at a friend.
Now you both tap knuckles as you smile....
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What's up? It's a great day. 
I'm thankful to be with you.
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What's up? 
I'm happy to (feel this way).- 3x
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Right hand, to a friend's right hand, then lock your thumbs.
Flutter up and do the butterfly...
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What's up? It's a great day.

Lyrics:
Let's take a walk in the jungle.
Walking in the jungle. Walking in the jungle.
We're not afraid. We're not afraid. 
Walking in the jungle. Walking in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.
Stop. Listen. What's that? 
It's a frog! 
We're not afraid! 

Let's stomp.
Stomping in the jungle. Stomping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
Stomping in the jungle. Stomping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.
Stop. Listen. What's that?
It's a monkey! 
We're not afraid!

Let's jump.
Jumping in the jungle. Jumping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
Jumping in the jungle. Jumping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.
Stop. Listen. What's that? 
It's a toucan! 
We're not afraid!

Let's skip.
Skipping in the jungle. Skipping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
Skipping in the jungle. Skipping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.
Stop. Listen. What's that?
It's a tiger!

FREE curriculum - Kindness Counts: Exploring Random Acts of Kindness: http://www.tonychestnut.com/BookAboutTonyCurriculum.pdf
Bucket fillers' are those who help without being asked, give hugs and compliments, and generally spread their love and good feelings to others.  Why teach kindness?  There have been numerous studies which demonstrate the positive effects of kindness on health and well-being.  The kindness giver, receiver and even those observing the kind act immediately experience an increase in happiness, a blissful sense of euphoria, increase in energy, more optimism and a general feeling of being healthy.  Children who learn about compassion, respect, empathy and how to express acts of kindness in both words and actions, can have a positive impact on the world they live in.  It is proven that young children raised to understand the value of kindness are less likely to bully or even become violent.   
Remember you can make a difference each time you brighten someone's life through small efforts like a smile, kind word, saying thank you or showing you care.

Words for your word wall: ""Friendship""  ""Kindness"" ""Helpful"" ""Polite"" ""Caring"" ""Respect"" ""Empathy"" ""Compassion"" ""Sympathy"" ""Concern"" ""Sharing"" 


Hold the hands of the friends on either side of you,
And don't let go at all. It's what we all should do.

Refrain: It's only holding hands but it means so much.
We're filling buckets with just a simple touch.
Let's be bucket fillers. That's what we all should be.
Our bucket is invisible. It's really make-believe.
But there's no doubt in what a kind act can do.
It makes someone feel good, then comes right back to you.

Chorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.
When we're nice, we fill yours too.
When we help, we fill our bucket.
When we smile, we fill yours too.
Keep holding hands and sway from side to side.                                                                                                                                   We feel much better now, and we know why.
Refrain: It's only holding hands but it means so much.
We're filling buckets with just a simple touch.
Let's be bucket fillers. That's what we all should be.
Our bucket is invisible. It's really make-believe.
But there's no doubt in what a kind act can do.
It makes someone feel good, then comes right back to you.

Chorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.
When we're nice, we fill yours too.
When we help, we fill our bucket.
When we smile, we fill yours too.
Keep holding hands and standing straight and tall.
Bring your hands up real high and don't let go at all.

Refrain: It's only holding hands but it means so much.
We're filling buckets with just a simple touch.
Let's be bucket fillers. That's what we all should be.
Our bucket is invisible. It's really make-believe.
But there's no doubt in what a kind act can do.
It makes someone feel good, then comes right back to you.

Chorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.
When we're nice, we fill yours too.
When we help, we fill our bucket.
When we smile, we fill yours too.
Keep holding hands and shout, ""Hip, Hip, Hooray!""
Let's celebrate filling our buckets today.
When you wake up tomorrow to start your day,
Refill your bucket with all you do and say.

Chorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.
When we're nice, we fill yours too.
When we help, we fill our bucket.
When we smile, we fill yours too.
Chorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.

 This cool, kid-friendly song starts out with a message about staying healthy and fit and having fun counting to 100 together.   It's a great count to 100 song for Kindergarten.
I show the children simple, easy to do exercises for each 10 numbers. Children have a variety of gross motor movements to do as they count to 100. 
    The songs great beat and steady counting motivate children to keep moving all the way to 100. We show the numbers  from 1 to 100 very large and clear so children also get the visual number recognition and stimulation. 
    This count to 100 song will engage your children with the catchy up tempo music, the clear numeral visuals and seeing Jack sing and demonstrate the exercises.
     Use Count to 100 - Let's Get Fit every day to strengthen your children's ability to count to 100 and help them enjoy and have fun exercising  too.
     Counting to 100 and basic number recognition is a standard in most early childhood ( pre-k, K and 1st grade)  classrooms.
This is a great math song to start your day with, as a brain break or use it during indoor recess. 
    PE Teachers will love  Count to 100 too as it emphasizes physical education and aerobic exercise as children count to 100.

So, count to 100 and follow Zero the Hero while exercising, getting smarter, stronger and healthier.

Just for your information, I wrote this song, but our, count to 100 Zero the Hero character, is played by our friend Mark. He was a good sport to do this, and is a really great guy.

I’m throwing snowballs
I’m gonna freeze
I’m hugging a polar bear

I’m blasting the AC

I’m sleeping in an igloo

After the RoboTots kids Star Wars workout, blast off to Star Wars Land for a kids educational tour of Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland. The city of Batuu at Galaxys edge is so realistic. There are storm troopers, scoundrels and Jedi roaming around, so we must be very careful. The Star Wars learning adventure starts with the Millennium Falcon and we learn to count to 12 parsecs. Our preschool age son is a big Star Wars fan. First we took him on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disneyland Galaxys Edge. Next we found the Droid Depot at Star Wars land and learned how to build our very own droid. R-series or BB unit. We chose the R series like R2-D2. Learn about colors, pick your favorite parts and put it together. The activated droid communicates with other droids in Disneyland Star Wars land. Next we see a sign in a foreign language. We learn about Aurebesh the mythical language of Star Wars. We check out the milk stand. Have you ever tried blue or green milk? Watch how RoboDad drinks the milk. We had so much fun showing you around Disneyland Galaxy Edge for kids! We hope you enjoyed the educational adventure. May the force be with you!

Educational studies have shown that movement and exercise increase oxygen to the brain for improved active learning. Your children will love doing this song over and over because it actively engages them with what they are learning. We keep the movements very simple so all children can easily participate. Letting our children experience learning with their brain and body helps them make deeper emotional, interpersonal and kinesthetic connections to the academic subject. According to Harvard Medical School’s Professor John Ratey, in a 2008 Education Week article, “physical exercise puts the brain of the child in the optimal position for learning.”

I say the letter sounds very clearly and accurately. I don't extend additional sounds to the individual sound of each letter. Your children follow my suggested movements as they say the letter, the sound and a word beginning with the letter. 

Teachers and reading specialists have guided us to say the letter sound before the word for your children to hear the initial letter sound starting the word. Our only exception is the using the word fox with the letter x, because the x in fox accurately makes the (ks – sound). Let your children have fun exercising and learning their letter sounds with Letter Sounds Workout.

Actively participating in this song daily will help your class achieve the Common Core and national standard of learning one to one letter sound correspondence.

Lyrics
Tick- tock let's learn about the clock
Tick-tock the analog clock

You see them on your wall 
In the classroom or the hall
A lot of people wear them on their wrist
It's the analog clock

Now sing after me and let's learn about the analog clock
Analog clocks can be the shape of a circle
Analog clocks can be the shape of a circle
The numbers on the clock go from 1 to 12
The numbers on the clock go from 1 to 12
A short hand and long hand go round and round
A short hand and long hand go round and round
Both hands go round both day and night
Both hands go round both day and night
And we always say O'clock on the hour
A short hand tells the hours on the clock
A short hand tells the hours on the clock
A short hand moves one number each hour
A short hand moves one number each hour
A long hand tells the minutes on the clock
A long hand tells the minutes on the clock
A long hand goes all around each hour
A long hand goes all around each hour
And we always say O'clock on the hour

Tick- tock let's learn about the clock
Tick-tock the analog clock
Tick- tock let's learn about the clock
Tick-tock the analog clock

Did you know that heavy metal toxicity is passed down 4 GENERATIONS! 

Setting up a foundation for your children begins before conception has even happened. 

The strength of the cord depends on the Mother’s nutritional foundation from 6 months prior to conception, so it is apparent that Mothering begins even before the child is born. 

The Women N Wellness dive into the different stages from preconception all the way to the teen years, and talk about how you can empower yourself to help your children thrive in today’s toxic world. 

Learn all about the Microbiome and how your birth, and your child’s birth, can influence their immune system, mood, and overall health.  

Dr Sonya and Dr Mindy talk about their own children and what has worked for them to help you implement these strategies for your family. 

Oh and they also get vulnerable and share their experience with Mommy Guilt…we have all been there!

The Math Flow Chart was an idea that came to me working with different grade levels, using these different tools, but frequently in isolation.  It got me thinking that I've never seen a big picture look at all of them to help bring understanding to how each works and how they are all connected.  Let me know what you think, or if you've seen something like it before.  My initial vision is that it would be something you'd visit at the start of a new unit when you introduce a new tool.  You or the students could slide the counters around to show what they look like on each tool including the new one you are bringing out for the first time (same counters, but different way to make sense of them).

The new tool to me this year is the ""number steps"" which my TK general ed. teachers introduced to the students during early counting/number rec. units.  I like how it visually represents the increase in quantity, and is a precursor to bar graphs.

Verse:
I’m a perky disco turkey because I love to dance. (Wiggle and point disco style)
I know this may seem bizarre. (Hold your palms up)
It’s the coolest thing to do. (Thumbs up)
That’s why I’m such a star. (Bow)

Chorus:
Step side to side, reach high and low. 
Wiggle your shoulders
And make a pose. (Freeze in place momentarily for a photograph)
(Repeat) Side to side, high and low. 
Shake your feathers (Wiggle your shoulders and whole body)
And point your toes. 
Now say gobble, gobble, gobble. (Gobble, gobble, gobble.)
And a strut, strut, strut. (And a strut, strut, strut.)
Do a wobble, wobble, wobble. (Wobble, wobble, wobble.)
And then we got stuck! (And then we got stuck!) WOW!

During music intro: Wiggle and point disco style

That’s why I’m such a star. (Bow)

Repeat Chorus

Verse: (Sing along)
Now, we turkey discoed a mighty fine dance. (Wiggle and point disco style)
And we’re proud of how we moved. (Bow)
It was so much fun, we don’t want to be done. (Thumbs up and then shake pointer finger)
So, let’s give it one more groove. (Hold your palms up)

Children will learn the moves to this fun Hip Hop dance song! 

Hip Hop (Slow) is a great brain breaks action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also great for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Hip Hop (Slow)
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 

LYRICS:

My name is Hip Hop Don with street clothes on.
I'm here to show you whereupon
I say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.

Now face your palms down. The points of your fingers face each other.
Lift up and push down, that's good, let's do another.
But this time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.
Just like a puppet string, (it's attached)
It moves at your command. Right knee, up down, (3X) left knee, up down, (3X)

Chorus:
Keep doing it, you got that right.
This hip hop stuff is out of sight.
And now let's try a brand new thing.
In a while, right now let's sing.
H to the I, I to the P, that's hip... H to the O, O to the P, that's hop. It's hip hop.

Use your hands to fan your face.
Keep doing this and keep the pace. 
And while you're doing that, take giant steps to the right and to the left.

Repeat Chorus

Stand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat (in and out)
Now bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat
Add your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat
Make your way back up, that move is complete.

Repeat Chorus

Point your toes, first in then out.
And that will move you all about.
Now raise your arms swing them around,
Side to side, up and down.

Repeat Chorus

Hands on your knees now jump real small, it looks just like your sliding.
Jump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and...
Use your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!
A ""Y"" hand means, WHATEVER! And an open hand means STOP!
Repeat Chorus (2x to end)

This song speeds up a lot. Use hand over hand motion for
climbing. Sway from side to side pretending to hold a vine
and jump. Bang your chest for hungry, chomp with open
and closed fingers. Rub your belly for “Mmm good”.
Tarzan was climbing up the vine. Jane and the monkey came down
swinging and swinging from side to side until they
hit the ground. Then Tarzan said, “I’m hungry”,
Jane said, “Me too.” Monkey said, “Eeet, eeet”
They all sat and ate the food. Chomp, Chomp,
Mmm good. Chomp, Chomp, Mmm good. Chomp,
Chomp, Mmm good. Chomp, Chomp.

This is where your kind words start. Take your arms and share it all around.
Chorus:
You give me sparkle. (Hold your arms up and wiggle your fingers) I give it back to you. (Point to yourself and then a friend)
Now we both have sparkle. (Hold your arms up and wiggle your fingers) It’s sparkle times two. (Hold up 2 fingers)
Reach your arms up towards the stars. Grab some sparkle holding hands.
This is where your helping starts. Take your arms and share it all around.
Reach your arms up towards the stars. Grab some sparkle touch your head.
This is where your kind thoughts start. Take your arms and share it all around.

Reach your arms up towards the stars. Grab some sparkle and hug yourself.

Reach your arms up towards the stars. Grab some sparkle touch your heart,

Only $4.99 USD per month and $44.99 USD for a year!

Our ""Action Song for Kids"" is a funky and bouncy dance tune that introduces the action verbs ""clap"", ""stomp"", ""swing"", ""dance"", ""sing"", jump"", ""touch"",  and ""shake"". In the video, our robot and the little chicks present a funky choreography on the dance floor, while Mother Hen and the band are singing their hearts out! 

This song can be used in the classroom or at home to encourage learning through music and body movement. The rhythm, musical arrangement, lyrics, and animation all work together to teach action verbs in the most effective way possible!

Young learners of English will also love this video, as it is easy to sing along (lots of lines are short and repeated often) and the words are written and acted out on the screen.

All these skills are very important developmental skills for young children. 
This pirate song for kids continues to be one of my most popular original songs. Children really use their imaginations as they act out each character's part. There are movements and lots of repetition to build brain and body connections.
Teachers and Parents can extend the learning after the video by asking these questions. 
Who is your favorite character?
Can you tell me what order the characters appear in?
How many characters did you see?
What is the setting of the story?
The simple rhythm and great melody of Silly Pirate Song continues to make this pirate song for kids a favorite of children around the world.

Shake your head to the color red
Twist your shoes to the color blue
Wiggle like Jello to the color yellow
Make your body lean to the color green

Rock your body to the colors

Touch your back to the color black
Jump up and down to the color brown
Stretch to the right for the color white
Turn in a circle for the color purple

Rock your body to the colors
Rock your body to the colors you see.

Hands up and sway to the color grey
Use your brain and think to the color pink
Make the shape of the orange for the color orange
Fly like a manta to the color magenta

Rock your body to the colors
Rock your body to the colors you see.

And shine it over head. Now wash your hands and shine your

Do the shiny clean dance. Do the shiny clean dance.

Now wash your hands and shine your seat. Turn one time and

A tongue twisting fun action, dance and movement song for children. 
Concepts children can learn:
-Having fun is fun.
-Being silly is fun.
-Having fun can be silly.
-Willy is silly fun.
Seriously, learning should be a fun, motivating experience. This rap song utilizes silly movements to help develop a child’s memory skills, listening skills, language/articulation, balance/coordination and large muscles.
Suggestions:
1. Ask the children, “Do you want to get Silly?” “Do you want to have fun?”
2. Turn on the song and have the children respond to the echoes and silly movements.
3. Children can look around the room pretending to try and find Willy.
4. When Willy appears listen carefully and he will direct you how to move, sing and dance!

The melody and rhythm are so catchy that the counting by 100's will simply stick in their brain, and they'll always remember.  Your children will sing along and they will want to dance along, too, to this upbeat, cool tune.  Counting by 100's to 1000 will be a self-esteem builder, too, because they will feel so good knowing they can count up so high.   Kids really have fun when they count big numbers like counting by 100 to 1000.   Teachers can extend this count by 100's to 1,000 skill by introducing the importance of the number zero.  You can discuss how the zeroes hold the place value for the tens, hundreds and thousands.  This song is so bright and upbeat your children will want to sing it all the time, and they'll really understand how to count by 100's all the way to 1,000.


LYRICS: 
 
Chorus (x1)                
I like to count big numbers,
I like to count by hundreds,
I like to count big numbers,
C’mon join me now, 
 
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred,
Four hundred, five hundred, six hundred,
Seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred,
One thousand!

Let's do it again!
 
(Repeat counting by hundreds)
 
Repeat Chorus and Counting

Recycling is a process of turning used waste and materials into new products.  This prevents potentially useful materials from being wasted as well as reducing energy use and pollution.  Children can follow this recycle song very easily because of the simple words and messages.  The song then sings about specific materials to recycle – paper, cardboard, glass, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, newspapers and magazines.  In the video, we show children, mom’s, dad’s and families recycling at home and at school.

Extend the learning and message of our song Recycle by helping children understand all the different ways recycling helps out own environment and the world.  You can go on the internet and learn so many more facts about recycling (ie: 75% of garbage is recyclable, but we only recycle about 30%.)

Lyrics:
Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way
Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way

Recycle paper, cardboard, glass
Recycle, plastic bottles, aluminum cans
Recycle, newspapers and magazines
You can do it, recycle every day

Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way
Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way

Recycle paper, cardboard, glass
Recycle, plastic bottles, aluminum cans
Recycle, newspapers and magazines
You can do it, recycle every day

Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way
Re-re-re-recycle every day, just a little goes a long way

Nursery Rhyme Dance
From the CD, ""#1 Best Kid's Songs!""
by The Learning Station
℗© Monopoli/The Learning Station

Lyrics:

(Free dance during the Refrains. During the Choruses Don sings the directions he wants you to follow. As each new nursery rhyme 
character is introduced, pretend to play their instrument. (guitar, bugle and drums) Replace Humpty Dumpty in refrains with 
underlined characters.)

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King's horses, and all the King's men, couldn't put Humpty together again!

Refrain: Now, you might think that it's the end to this rhyme...but Humpty Dumpty had something in mind. He got back together with Little Bo Beep and they began to dance to this funky dance beat! 

Chorus: Bust a move, dance with your feet, put your hands in the air and sing, 
ahhh eee ahh eee. Move your feet, put your arms out to the side, 
move them up and down and sing i ee i 

Old King Cole was a merry old sole. A merry old sole was he. He grabbed his guitar, 
just like a rock star and jammed with his fiddlers three. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 
Little Boy Blue came to blow his horn, the best bugle blower around. He blew and he blew, that's what he liked to do, he really knew how to get down. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 
Little Jack Horner jumped out of his corner and put away his Christmas pie. He stuck in his thumb and pulled out a drum and played it till the time flew by. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 2x

From All-Time Childrens' Favorites
By The Learning Station
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics:
You put your right foot in, you take your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your right arm in, you take your right arm out, you put your right arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you take your left arm out, you put your left arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your head in, you take your head out, you put your head in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your knees in, you take your knees out, you put your knees in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your shoulders in, you take your shoulders out, you put your shoulders in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your elbows in, you take your elbows out, you put your elbows in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your bottom in, you take your bottom out, you put your bottom in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your quiet voice in, you take your quiet voice out, you put your quiet in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.
You put your loud voice in, you take your loud voice out, you put your loud voice in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your tummy in, you take your tummy out, you put your tummy in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your nose in, you take your nose out, you put your nose in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your whole self in, you take your whole self out, you put your whole self in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

From the CD, ""Children's Favorite Autumn Songs & Fingerplays""

℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics: 
Way up high in an apple tree, (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Five red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 5 fingers)
I shook that tree as hard as I could, (Pretend to shake the tree)
Down came an apple! Mmmmm it was good!
(Rub your tummy in a circle motion)

Way up high in that apple tree, 
(Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Four red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 4 fingers)

Way up high in that apple tree.
(Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Four red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 4 fingers)
I shook that tree as hard as I could. (Pretend to shake the tree)
Down came an apple! Mmmmm it was good! 
(Rub your tummy in a circle motion)

Way up high in that apple tree, (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Three red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 3 fingers)

Way up high in that apple tree. (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Three red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 3 fingers)
I shook that tree as hard as I could. (Pretend to shake the tree)
Down came an apple! Mmmmm it was good! (Rub your tummy in a circle motion)

Way up high in that apple tree, (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Two red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 2 fingers)

Way up high in that apple tree. (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
Two red apples smiled down at me. (Hold up 2 fingers)
I shook that tree as hard as I could. (Pretend to shake the tree)
Down came an apple! Mmmmm it was good! (Rub your tummy in a circle motion)

Way up high in that apple tree, (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
One red apple smiled down at me. (Hold up 1 finger)

Way up high in that apple tree. (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)

Way up high in that apple tree, (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
No red apples smiled down at me. (Hide your hands behind your back.)

Way up high in that apple tree. (Hold up both your hands and spread your fingers for pretend apple tree)
No more apples smiling down at me. (Hide your hands behind your back.)
I shook that tree as hard as I could. (Pretend to shake the tree)
Down came no apples! They're gone for good! (Hide your hands behind your back.)

Stand up, get ready to move
Move like a state of matter
Right to the grove
Then stop and say

Move your arms and hands like a waterfall

Stand up straight like a flagpole

Wiggle your fingers up like water vapor
Water vapor is a --------- gas

Roll your arms around like a wheel
A wheel is a ------------ solid

Let's have more fun and move

Breath in deep and blow out air
Air is a ---------------- gas

Push piles of dirt like a bulldozer
A bulldozer is a -----------------  solid

Surf and ride the waves in the ocean
The ocean is a ---------------- liquid

Chug- chug choo-choo like a train
A train is a ----------------  solid

Look all around everyday
Observe and think
Is it a solid, a liquid or a gas?
Is it a solid, a liquid or a gas?
Is it a solid, a liquid or a gas?

It's one of my favorites because it engages children in creative active movement. Jack Hartmann clearly and accurately says each letter sound and a word that begins with that letter to act out. 

Act Out the Alphabet aligns with the Common Core standard for Phonics, (ccss.ela-literacy.RF.K.3a). Demonstrating basic knowledge of one-to-one letter sound correspondences.

This letter sounds song is also excellent for basic alphabet recognition. As I say each letter we clearly show the upper and lower case letter for children to see. I demonstrate the motion for the action words so children can see how to move.

Your children will love singing and moving to this letter sounds song daily; helping them learn their letter sounds.

Teachers tell me it's one of their favorites for developing phonological awareness and working on phonics skills.

Lyrics:
Act Out The Alphabet
Move your body like a monster
Chomp your arms like a shark
Pump it up like a body builder
Take a bow like you’re a star
Here’s your chance to be an actor
Do your best

Imagine you have a big soup pot in front of you. When the song directs you to add a new ingredient, pretend to be placing it into the pot, then stir your soup and scoop a taste. Follow along with the call backs. For the final verse, pretend you are filling bowls and then everyone gobbles up their soup. Variation: To enhance the message of team work have the children take turns adding each ingredient.

And one fell out

Roll over, roll over

There were four in a bed

Cross lateral movements are movements that cross the midline of the brain.The midline is an imaginary line that runs down the middle of the body from head to toes, dividing the body into right and left halves. When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the midline. Crossing midline activities promote communication between the two hemispheres of the brain.  

Crossover tells children exactly what part of the body to crossover from right to left and left to right. Crossover is very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.

Crossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right. When we engage children in crossover movements blood flow is increased in all parts of the brain making it more alert and energized for optimal learning.

Use this song as a great musical brain breaks activity for stimulating the brain and body.

Children will learn the moves to this fun Hip Hop dance song! 

Hip Hop (Fast) is a great brain breaks action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also ideal for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Hip Hop (Fast)
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 

LYRICS:
I'm hip hop Don with street clothes on. I'm here to show you whereupon,
I say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.
Palms down, the points of your fingers face each other.
Lift up and push down. That's good let's do another.
This time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.
Just like a puppet string, it moves at your command.
Right knee Up, down (4x) left knee Up, down (4x)

Chorus:
Keep doing it, you got that right.
This hip hop stuff is out of sight.
And now let's try a brand new thing.
In a while, right now let's sing.
H to the I, I to the P that's hip; H to the O, O to the P that's hop. It's hip hop.

Fan with your hands, cool down your face.
Keep doing this and keep the pace.
Take giant steps to the right and left.
Now back up and retrace your steps and stop.

Chorus

Point your toes first in then out.
And that will move you all about.
Now raise your arms. Swing them around
Side to side, up and down, now stop.

Chorus

Stand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat.
Now bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat.
Add your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat.
Make your way back up, that move is complete.

Chorus

Hands on your knees now jump real small. It looks just like your sliding.
Jump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and
Use your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!
A ""Y"" hand means whatever, and an open hand means STOP!

Chorus

LYRICS:
(The Bear Hunt is a story time & camp song for kids.) We’re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big oak tree right in front of me. It’s so wide we can’t go around it. But then, can we go over it? (No) Can we go under it? (Uh,Uh) Looks like we’re gonna have to climb. Okay, hand over hand, up, up, up, higher and higher right to the top. Look around do you see any bears? (No) Then, hand under hand, down, down, down, lower and lower right to the ground. Look around do you see any bears? (No) . We’re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big swamp right in front of me. It’s so wide we can’t go around it. But then, can we go over it? (No) Can we go under it? (Uh,Uh) Looks like we’re gonna have to trudge. Step by step, trudge, trudge, trudge, in-between my toes, I can feel the mud. Look around do you see any bears? (No) 

Well then, step by step, trudge, trudge, trudge, we made it through the swamp now shake off the mud. Look around do you see any bears? (No)
We’re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big lake right in front of me.
It’s so wide we can’t go around it. But then, can we go over it? (No) Can we go under it? (Uh,Uh) Looks like we’re gonna have to swim. 
Okay, swim, swim, swim, splash, splash, splash, stroke, stroke, stroke, we’re swimming really fast. Look around do you see any bears? (No)
Swim, swim, swim, splash, splash, splash, we made it through the lake now dry off really fast. 
Look around do you see any bears? (No) We’re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big cave right in front of me. I heard that bears are asleep this time of day. 
If you want to go in we’ll have to be real quiet, okay? (okay) Crawling to the cave, creep, creep, creep. Crawling in the cave I hope the bear’s asleep. Look around do you see any bears? (No)
Wait a minute, I see eyes, big yellow eyes, they’re not yours and they’re not mine. 
They must belong to the bear. AHHHH! Running from the bear cave and what do we see but the great big lake right in front of me. Looks like we’re gonna have to swim. Swim, swim, swim, splash, splash, splash, we made it through the lake now dry off really fast.
Look around do you see any bears? (No) Still running from the bear cave and what do we see but the great big swamp right in front of me. Looks like we’re gonna have to trudge. Step, step, step, trudge, trudge, trudge, we made it through the swamp now, shake off all the mud.
Look around do you see any bears? (No) Still running from the bear cave and what do we see but a great big oak tree right in front of me. Looks like we’re gonna have to climb. 
Hand over hand up, up, up, down, down, down, right to the ground.Look around do you see any bears? (No) We finally made it back but I’m feeling kind of funny, we were being chased by a little bitty bunny. Looks like we went to the wrong cave. We’ll save going on a bear hunt again for another day.

The Cat Came Back
From the CD, Kid's Country Song & Dance
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
THE CAT CAME BACK 
Old Mr. Johnson had some troubles of his own.
He had a yellow cat which wouldn't leave his home.
He tried and tried to give the cat away.
He gave it to a man going far, far away.
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away
He gave it to a farmer, said he'd take it to a farm.
The farmer drove the tractor with the cat under his arm.
He dropped it in a cornfield, thought he'd surely get lost.
The cat ate up the cornfield at the farmer's cost.
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away
He gave it to a trucker that was going to Mexico.
The trucker stopped for coffee at a ""Trucker Stop & Go"".
But while he was a' paying he knew that he was stuck
He saw the cat jump in the cab and take off with his truck.
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away
He gave it to a pilot with a real nice plane.
The pilot could just fly it far away in one day.
But the pilot had his troubles he couldn't touch down.
Because the cat had the controls and made the pilot turn around.
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away
He gave it to a train conductor, put it on a train
New England's where the train was headed up to Bangor Maine
He pull down on the brakes those wheels screeched on the track
And as it ran away, conductor said, ""Here, kitty cat"".
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The cat was taken in by a lovely little girl
She loved that yellow cat, she made that cat her world
Now there is no reason for the cat to come back
Cuz it never has to leave and it likes it like that.
Chorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.
The cat came back. We thought he was a goner.
But the cat came back. It just couldn't stay away.
Away, Away, Away
It likes it where it is. It loves that little girl.

Echo Dance is full of simple and easy rhymes, movements and repeat after me motions.

Children are totally engaged with echoing all the words that I sing while engaging in different dances.  Rhyming awareness and listening for rhymes is so important in language development for the young child.
  
Children who are able to distinguish different sounds and phonemes are more likely to develop stronger literacy skills over time (Ehri et al. 2001). Music supports this critical skill because songs include rhyming or substituting one sound for another (US Dept. of Health and Human Services).

Children can follow me in my dance moves and repeat after me rhyming lines.  This movement and rhyming song is wonderful for a fun and effective brain breaks activity.

LYRICS:

The Echo Dance

Let's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance
Let's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance
With your hips, with your arms, with your hands
Follow me, do the Echo Dance

Do the twist, just like this                       (children repeat each line)
Do the shake, it's a piece of cake
Do the hop, don't you stop
Do the swing, it's a groovy thing

Let's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance
Let's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance
With your hips, with your arms, with your hands
Follow me, do the Echo Dance

Do the stomp, you can really romp
Do the choo choo train, right down the lane
Do the swim, like you've got fins
Do the monkey, it's really funky

Let's do it, let's do it, The Echo Dance

There's a very special animal that lives down by the lake
All the children go to see him as he swims and dives and plays

Go Bananas
From the CD, #1 Best Kid's Songs
by The Learning Station
℗© Monopoli/The Learning Station
Lyrics:
(Repeat each line and perform each movement with your hands and body.)
 
Form, form, form the banana. Peel, peel, peel the banana. (Form the banana by
holding your arms out straight to your side and then slowly bring them up until they
are over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.
 
Slice, slice, slice the banana. Go, go, go bananas. Go bananas! (Pretend you are
slicing with a knife and go bananas with a crazy dance.)
 
Form, form, form the potato. Peel, peel, peel the potato. (Form the potato by holding
your arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they
meet over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Slice, slice, slice the potato. Mash, mash, mash the potato. Now mash! (Pretend you
are slicing with a knife and then mash by stomping your feet.)
 
Form, form, form the orange. Peel, peel, peel the orange. (Form the orange by holding
your arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they
meet over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Slice, slice, slice the orange. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the orange. (Pretend you
are slicing with a knife. For squeeze you can either hug the person next to you or
pretend you are squishing an orange between both of your hands.)
Now squeeze!
 
Form, form, form the guitar. Play it like a rock star. (Pretend you are playing a guitar.)
Jump, jump like a rock star. Rock, rock, rock the guitar. Now rock! (Jump up and down
and rock out with your pretend guitar)
 
Form, form, form the corn. Shuck, shuck, shuck the corn. (Form the corn by holding
your arms out straight to your side and then slowly bring them up until they are over
your head. Shuck by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Cut, cut, cut the corn. Now, pop, pop, pop the corn. Now pop! (Pretend you are
scraping the kernels off the corn and then jump around the room like popping
popcorn.)
 
Form, form, form a big ball. Kick, kick, kick the big ball. (Form the ball by holding your
arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they meet
over your head. Pretend to drop the ball and kick it.)                                                                                                                                        
 
Throw, throw, throw the big ball. Bounce, bounce, bounce the big ball. (Using both
hands pretend to throw a big ball and then jump up and down like a bouncing ball.)
Now bounce!

LYRICS
You can tell the world you never was my girl 
You can​ ​rip my clothes up when I'm gone 
You can tell your friends just what a fool I've been 
And laugh and joke about me on the phone 
You can tell my arms go back to the farm 
You can tell my feet to hit the floor 
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips 
They won't be reaching out for you no more
But don't tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
I just don't think he'd understand 
And if you tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
He might break down inside this man 
You can tell your mom I moved to Arkansas 
You can tell your dog to ​lick my leg 
Or tell your brother Cliff that I just went and split 
He never really liked me anyway 
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anyone you please 
Myself already knows I'm not OK. 
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind 
It might be walking out on me today 
But don't tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
I just don't think he'd understand 
And if you tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
He might break down inside this man 
But don't tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
I just don't think he'd understand 
And if you tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
He might break down inside this man 
But don't tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
I just don't think he'd understand 
And if you tell my heart 
My achy breaky heart 
He might break down inside this man",Kids brain break,false

LYRICS:
(Activity: This is a repeat after me song. Follow the actions for the song. Have fun rhyming as you do the action and dance moves.)

The Princess Pat lived in a tree. She sailed across the seven seas.  She sailed across the channel, too. 
And she brought with her, a rick-a-bamboo. A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat. It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 
Now, Captain Jack had a mighty fine crew. They sailed across the channel, too. 
But their ship sank and yours will too, if you don’t take a rick-a-bamboo. 
A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat.  
It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 

The Princess Pat saw Captain Jack. She reeled him in and brought him back.  
She saved his life and his crew, too. Do you know how?  
With a rick-a-bamboo. A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat.  
It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 
That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo.

Children just love to dance and freeze and this super simple freeze dance song is absolutely perfect for a quick brain break to get all those wiggles out.  

Classroom teachers, parents and P.E. teachers can use this freeze dance song any time through out the day as a great brain breaks activity.  Children can follow my dance moves or be creative and do their own dance moves and freeze.  

The Bop Stop freeze dance song also helps children with listening skills and body coordination to move when the music is playing and freezing when it stops.  I purposefully made the song have a great beat, but not too fast, so little ones could more easily follow the dance moves and freeze with success.  

So, take a brain break when you need it and have fun doing the Bop Stop.

Lyrics
You can move to the beat
Shake your hands and your feet 
Do the Bop Stop

You can dance all around
Move your body to the sound
Do the Bop Stop

You can boogie, really move
You can twist really move
You can jump do the bop
But don't move when I stop

You can wiggle way down low
Let your body really go
Do the Bop Stop

You can dance really cool
Let your body really move
Do the Bop Stop

You can boogie, really move
You can twist really move
You can jump do the bop
But don't move when I stop

You can move to the beat
Shake your hands and your feet

Lyrics:
Science, Oh, Oh, Oh
Science is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
 Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that’s called migration, hibernation, migration.
Frogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that’s called hibernation.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Evaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn’t last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can’t see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Gravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Metamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don’t know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Science is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.
Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.

Why take brain breaks?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing children to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  

The Learning Station has created this brain breaks action, dance song to make it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh then they can return to their academics feeling happy, joyous, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realizing the significant values of brain breaks for both students and teachers. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress.

Form, form, form the banana. Peel, peel, peel the banana. (Form the banana by

Slice, slice, slice the potato. Mash, mash, mash the potato. Now mash! (Pretend you
are slicing with a knife and then mash by stomping your feet.)

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

The repetition  and rhyming in Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star is helpful in teaching kids how language development works. Kids love to sing and dance along with the Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star with all the characters they know and love.

Nursery Rhymes help with a child’s language development. Kids hear and say vowel and letter sounds repeatedly throughout the song, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.   Nursery rhymes are filled with alliteration. As they sing a nursery rhyme they get a sense for rhythm and can help develop other important language skills such as inflection.
 
Nursery Rhymes are also important as they are often where a child hears a word for the first time, building their vocabulary. Nursery rhymes are also a great introduction to sentence and story structure because they are short and easy to remember, making them repeatable, too. Nursery rhymes are good for simple story telling as they usually have an identifiable beginning, middle and end. Kids easily memorize and recall the stories, especially when the nursery rhymes are set to music.

Nursery rhymes can build a child’s imagination as they need to visualize and often act out scenes in the nursery rhymes. Humpty Dumpty is a great example. Nursery rhymes such as Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star can help kids with developing gross and fine motor movements.

What you may not know is nursery rhymes can also help develop math skills as well. Many nursery rhymes involve the use of number, such as three blind mice, but also nursery rhymes rely on patterning and sequence. Math vocabulary words for measurement can also be introduced, for instance weight. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning.

Nursery rhymes also aid kids in developing socially as the characters in nursery rhymes are often portrayed in a variety of situations. These situations teach children about understanding their emotions and the emotion of others and how to identify what these emotions are.

Disney on Ice brings the magic of Disney to your home town. Our daughter loves Frozen and we can't wait for Frozen 2, so we were looking for a show with Elsa and Anna. We are so happy we went to Oakland CA for Disney on Ice - Worlds of Enchantment. It was even better than we imagined!

We met up with a professional Disney on Ice figure skater, Morgan, who gave us some great information for kids interested in ice skating. Then we met the stars of the show, Mickey and Minnie at the Disney Blogger event. The tots loved the Olaf and Mickey collectible cups, Elsa and Mickey glow sticks and the whole experience. The show starts off with Minnie and Mickey, Donald and Goofy. We see Andy and all the beloved toys of Toy Story, Woody, Jessie, Buzz. The next act is Little Mermaid with Ariel, Sebastian, Ursula and Flounder. After the intermission we see Lightening McQueen, Mater and all the favorites from Disney's Cars. The show ends with an amazing performance by the characters in Frozen! Our favorites, Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff skate around Arendell and everyone sings Let it Go! Our 3 and 4 year old kids were fascinated by Disney on Ice the entire time! Check out the upcoming shows in your area. You won't want to miss it!

Thank you so much to Feld Entertainment and Atherton PR for inviting us to Disney on Ice!

Set to a cool beat children love, I made this wheels on the bus song so positive and fun with the driver welcoming people on the bus, mommies giving hugs and daddies giving high fives.

Children sing the wheels on the bus with me as they get up and move as they perform all the dance motions. This is a wonderful song to use during brain breaks. You can also follow along at home and do all these fun wheels on the bus moves.

The fun beat and positive characters will engage you children right away with a spirit of being a little silly and they will really enjoy moving their bodies. 

My Wheels on the Bus song will be their favorite version of the popular children's classic.

A choice will pop up while you are resting with an exercise.  You have to decide if you want to do that choice.

If your answer is “YES, DEAL!” that means you are taking the deal and will do that move when the next slide pops up and your 30 seconds of exercise starts.

If you do NOT want that choice then another choice will pop up when it is time to exercise.  That is called NO DEAL!

The No Deal choice will pop up and you will see what it is. You will also see your dance move or exercise for the 30 seconds of exercise.

Lyrics: 
♫ Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones. 
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Doin' the skeleton dance.

The foot bone's connected to the leg bone.
The leg bone's connected to the knee bone. 
The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. 
Doin' the skeleton dance.

The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone. 
The hip bone's connected to the backbone. 
The backbone's connected to the neck bone. 
Doin' the skeleton dance.

Shake your hands to the left.
Shake your hands to the right.
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands out of sight. 
Shake your hands to the left.
Shake your hands to the right.
Put your hands in the air.
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle...wiggle your knees. 

Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Doin' the skeleton dance. ♫

--- Guided Meditation Script
""Make your body comfortable, and when you’re ready, close your eyes

Let’s start by taking a few deep breaths.

Feel the air filling your tummy as you take a deep breath in thru your nose,

And make a big “aaaah” sound as you let the air out your mouth,

And each time you breathe out, feel your whole body becoming loose and floppy....

Take a few more big breaths like this

Now, you can start breathing normally again,

In and out thru your nose

When you breathe in, think about the word “In”,

And when you breathe out, think about the word “Out”,

Can you hear these words inside your head just by thinking about them, 

without making any sound with your mouth,

not even moving your tongue or your lips,

Let’s do this a bit longer,

Thinking about the word “In” when you breathe in,

And thinking about the word “Out” when you breathe out,

Feel how your stomach gets full like a balloon when you breathe in,

And gets smaller again when you let the air out

Now imagine that you are lying out on the grass in a beautiful park

The sun is shining and your eyes are closed

Just relaxing in the sunshine

As you lie there, a very friendly butterfly comes to say hello to you

Can you imagine this butterfly?  It can be any colour you choose

The butterfly is fluttering its wings just above your toes....

If you really pay attention, can you feel the soft breeze from the butterfly's wings on your toes?

Now the butterfly is floating along your legs to your knees.... 

Can you feel a little tingling feeling from its wings on your legs?

If you can’t feel anything, just imagine what it would feel like if you could,

Now the butterfly is fluttering its wings as it moves up to your belly button....

Can you feel it tickling your belly as it flies around?

Try to imagine what the butterfly’s wings look like?

Maybe you can see them, and feel them fluttering at the same time in your imagination?

Now the butterfly is floating up and down your arms,

From your shoulder to your hands and back

Feel it with your imagination as it flies up and down each arm, 

And now, just before flying off, the butterfly is coming to wish you a beautiful day,

As it flutters its wings just above your forehead!

See it floating there in your mind,

Feel the fluttering of its wings

If you listen very closely, you might be able to hear them flutter,

And now, off it flies..

Leaving you feeling very warm and cozy,

Just lying in the sunshine... 

Now, let’s just sit quietly and breathe for just a bit longer until you hear the bell.""",Kids brain break,false

Learning basic phonics, holidays, manners, mathematics, shapes, colors, nursery rhymes through engaging music is what you will find here at ""BlackBerry Jam Kids Music"". 

Education is the key to success. The main purpose of this channel is to provide a stimulating online learning environment for kids of all ages. 
A learning environment that encourages community,  acts as a guide for parents and promotes the individual skills as well as confidence in each child.

Throughout my teaching experience, I have found that children earn best when actively engaged and provided with multiple forms of instruction. When children make connections to past experiences they will not only retain information longer, but they will also master material and become more confident in their own abilities.

I am excited to provide an enriched educational experience to children from all over the world.

The Water Cycle is focused on the physical science topic of learning the three essential phases of the water cycle. Children sing along and can follow with movements and motions showing how the cycle goes round and round. The song includes a simple rap for each phase that describes the specific process in each phase. Your children will get all the basics about the water cycle’s 3 phases by listening to Jack’s song, Water Cycle.

LYRICS:
The Water Cycle –it goes around and round (Chorus)
The Water Cycle –keeps going up and down
The Water Cycle –it goes around and round,
 It goes around and round and round

Evaporation, condensation, precipitation
Keeps going round and round (repeat)
Keeps going round and round, and round

Evaporation –Happens first
The sun heats surface waters of the earth
The water’s changed to a gas right there
Gets lighter and rises into the air

Condensation –Is when the gas
Gets cooled in the upper atmosphere
Turns liquid or solid forming clouds
And, yo, it might start falling down

Precipitation –Is when the clouds
Get liquids or solids all around
The particles get heavy and grow
Then fall as rain, hail, sleet or snow

Repeat Chorus

The water cycle it keeps going round and round and round

LYRICS:
Halloween Is Here

Halloween is here 
Halloween
Halloween is here

Halloween is here
Halloween is there
And Halloween is everywhere

Big black cats and flying bats
Brooms and tombs
And strange perfume

Halloween is here 
Halloween
Halloween is here
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Halloween is here
And Halloween is there
Halloween is everywhere

Rats and vats and giant gnats
Goblins and ghosts
And things that are gross
 
Halloween is here 
Halloween
Halloween is here
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Halloween is here
And Halloween is there
Halloween is everywhere

Don’t get scared by the crazy hair
It’s a Halloween dare
So be prepared

Halloween is here 
Halloween
Halloween is here
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

The repetition in Peas Porridge is helpful in teaching kids how language works. Kids love to sing and dance along with the Peas Porridge with all the characters they know and love.

Nursery Rhymes help with a child’s language development. Kids hear and say vowel and letter sounds repeatedly throughout the song, Peas Porridge.   Nursery rhymes are filled with alliteration. As they sing a nursery rhyme they get a sense for rhythm and can help develop other important language skills such as inflection. 

Nursery Rhymes are also important as they are often where a child hears a word for the first time, building their vocabulary. Nursery rhymes are also a great introduction to sentence and story structure because they are short and easy to remember, making them repeatable, too. Nursery rhymes are good for simple story telling as they usually have an identifiable beginning, middle and end. Kids easily memorize and recall the stories, especially when the nursery rhymes are set to music.

Nursery rhymes can build a child’s imagination as they need to visualize and often act out scenes in the nursery rhymes. Humpty Dumpty is a great example. Nursery rhymes such as Peas Porridge can help kids with developing gross and fine motor movements.

What you may not know is nursery rhymes can also help develop math skills as well. Many nursery rhymes involve the use of number, such as three blind mice, but also nursery rhymes rely on patterning and sequence. Math vocabulary words for measurement can also be introduced, for instance weight. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning.

Nursery rhymes also aid kids in developing socially as the characters in nursery rhymes are often portrayed in a variety of situations. These situations teach children about understanding their emotions and the emotion of others and how to identify what these emotions are.

They'll want to do this song over and over again because it's just a fun repeat - after - me song that's so easy to do. 

I show the children the movements as they sing each line after me. Dig the peanuts, crack the shells, mash the peanuts, spread the peanut butter. They continue to finger play and pick the grapes, squish the grapes, spread the jelly and eat the sandwich.

Teachers can use the song as a simple, quick and easy brain breaks activity to help get a short break and feel refreshed to continue schoolwork.

This finger play has a great beat and the words are sung clearly so that children can easily repeat the words and do the movement.

Enjoy the Peanut Butter and Jelly Finger Play regularly with your little ones.

In this subitizing song  name the numbers in each set of dots, ten frames and fingers. Subitizing develops math fluency, when students recognize sets without having to count each object and it helps develop number sense and the ability to perform mental math. In this version we subitize up to 5 and then give the answer for reinforcement. Have fun subitizing with this subitize song.

Regeton Tooty Ta puede ayudar a los niños a enfocar su atención, también ayuda a tomar un descanso mental y físico de los estudios académicos y así ayudarlos a enforcarse mejor en el aprendizaje. 

Usando mi divertido Regeton como descanso se obtienen  dos beneficios; los estudiantes aprendren durante este descanso y también regresan a los estudios académicos renovados y con mucho mas energía.

Maestros de clase ,educación física o maestros que educan en las casas pueden fácil y rapidamente dar a los estudiantes un descanso lleno de diversion y energía  para sus cerebros.

I will give you 3 separate lists with items that you generally will have in and around your house.
The lists will pop up on the screen for 10 second and then you will have to see if you can find the items in under 3 minutes per list.
What do you need?
Plastic container or a basket. Any container will do, it does not need to be a big container.
And then a stopwatch. You will use the stopwatch to time yourself. You will have 3 minutes to complete a list.

You will have 10 sec to view a list that will pop up on screen. After 10 sec the screen will turn red and you will have to press pause.
Once you press pause you will start your stopwatch.
You then go on your 1st scavenger hunt. You have 3 minutes to complete the list. If you can’t find an item in under 3 minutes, don’t worry you will be able to look for that item during the other 2 hunts.
After 3 minutes you must return to your screen and press play so view your 2nd list.
Feel free to ask you parents for help as 3 minutes is a short time.
Repeat the process. In total there is 15 items on the lists. You score will be the total number of items that you have in your container/ basket at the end of the video.

Well done and I hope you found all the items on the lists

Sidney the Snake. Favourite animal song from kindyRock - great songs for little kids.

“Sidney the Snake” is a huge favourite song with preschoolers and toddlers. It’s a fun, action song for children that uses lots of animals and that they love to sing and dance along to.  It's a super easy song to sing along to and also super easy as an action and movement song for kids. With a snake the slithers, a frog that jumps, a seagull that flies, an elephant that sways and a crocodile that snaps along!


Kids love to sing and dance and move along with action songs just for children.  “Sidney the Snake” really is a great animal song. With actions and movement to suit every child’s ability.

Sing along with kindyRock creator Judi Cranston and her young friend Imogen, as she takes you through simple actions of 5 favourites animals and the way they move their bodies. The tempo gets slower at the end too, making this so much fun to sing along to. Help your children to be creative by showing them how to make up their own actions, learn new language and of course TO HAVE FUN! Children love to sing and dance to their own songs as well as kindyRock songs.

If you have landed on this Youtube channel it’s probably because you are a teacher to children aged under 7 years, you've heard about us through a school, kindergarten, daycare, yoga or music class, you're an in home educator or a parent who understands the importance of music education for children's development.  

At kindyRock we want to help support you in your teaching by providing you with Quality Music Education Resources.

As a teacher you will probably know how important and effective music is for our children’s brains and that you should be doing music regularly, even on a daily basis in your classes! If you don't feel comfortable singing, that's where we make it easy for you, guiding you and the children through these easy to remember songs, designed to support you and their learning needs.

Your children will love using their voices to sing , their hands to do the actions and their eyes to follow along with Judi Cranston. Your kids will have a blast with this exciting, silly and fun song! You can incorporate and encourage your children to join in which also helps them with rhythm and is perfect for brain breaks, circle time, group activities or those bad weather days when children can't go outside to play.

Sidney the Snake  is also easy and fun to play or pretend to play when you need a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh, they can then return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realising the significant values of breaks like this in the classroom.

HARRY KINDERGARTEN MUSIC FREEBIES:
This song is a FREEBIE. You can stream it for free on YouTube, but also buy it at my website. I am already offering 60+ of my hip educational songs/videos on YouTube FOR FREE at youtube.com/harrykindergarten. Enjoy them, utilize them, and share them! I am a current full-time Kindergarten teacher so I know what it's like to be looking around for quality content in my classroom! You can ALSO purchase the raw video file and/or audio file of those 60+ songs at my website (if you need them for some reason) or at Teachers Pay Teachers. I will continue to make freebie videos (ones you can just stream on YouTube for free) periodically, so continue to check back to see if I've posted any. 

*Please DO NOT rip any of my videos off of YouTube and upload them to your YouTube channel. I want the Harry Kindergarten Music channel to be the hotspot for these videos, not random teachers' channels who happened to illegally take them off of mine. If you really want to have a playlist of them, create a playlist from MY channel or purchase them on my website so you have the raw files. THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING!

Q: Do you speak at conferences?
A: Yes! My ability to speak at teacher conferences during the school year is ""tight"" because I am currently a classroom teacher and only have a set number of personal days. However, the SUMMER time is wide-open and I'd love to come to your conference and do a session/seminar! Some of the topics I've typically spoken to teachers about include music and technology in the classroom, classroom management, running a creative morning meeting, and utilizing YouTube in the early childhood classroom. Email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com to make a speaking request.

Q: Can my class perform a ""Harry Kindergarten song"" for an audience?
A: If you desire to have your class or group of students perform one of my “Harry Kindergarten” songs for an audience, please note that there is a $6.00 PERFORMANCE FEE.

Here are some hypothetical examples of performance groups:
* Students perform a song for an audience during a graduation ceremony.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school or community talent show.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school assembly.
If you are unsure if you need to purchase a performance license or not, please inquire at: pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com. If you want more details about using a song multiple years or multiple classes, etc., e-mail me for a detailed PDF file.

6:21 The Listening Game  | Cosmic Kids Zen Den - Let's play a game about listening! How well can you listen to the sounds of the bells? REALLY listen! If you listen really hard, it's amazing how long they go on for. If we can get our listening working well, we can experience the world so much more and enjoy ourselves even more!

12:21 The Owl and the Guard Dog | Cosmic Kids Zen Den
This is a story explaining how certain parts of our brain work - how the amygdala (our 'guard dog') can be so good at protecting us - a little TOO good - that it stops the thinking part of our brain (our 'owl' - the pre-frontal cortex) from doing its work!

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

 Lyrics:

This is a ""repeat after me"" song. Act out antlers with open hands and thumbs on your temples and spin during the 
Choruses.
There was a great big moose, 
who liked to drink a lot of juice. 
There was a great big moose, 
who liked to drink a lot of juice. 
Chorus: Singing whoa oh oh
Wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh 
Whoa oh oh 
Wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
The moose's name was Fred. 
He liked to drink his juice in bed. 
The moose's name was Fred. 
He liked to drink his juice in bed. 
Repeat Chorus
He drank his juice with care, 
but he spilt it in his hair. 
He drank his juice with care,

During this video, students are expected to follow the movement instructions that are shown on the screen. Each movement activity will last for 60 seconds before changing. The music in the video will motivate and inspire your students.

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

January 27, 2011 

John Stein Brain 101 Presentation part 2

More info: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7KdBy...


In the coming year, Everett Dance Theatre will create a multimedia dance/theater production entitled Brain Storm. The piece will examine new developments in brain research, and the imminent neurological revolution. Many experts believe we are currently at a tipping point in terms of our understanding of how the brain works. Soon we will all have to grapple with the potentially positive and ill effects of this radical paradigm shift, as it begins to affect our everyday lives. Medical, technological and pharmaceutical advancements will raise a host of important ethical questions, such as their use by the military, the legal system, advertisers, etc. Researchers are rapidly amassing knowledge enabling them to map the spectrum of human emotions, beliefs, and tendencies in our neural circuitry. Neuroplasticity, the idea of transforming our own brains by how and what we think, is a widely accepted phenomenon.

The brain holds an innate interest and is a rich subject for a dance/theater piece. It is perfectly suited to the kind of in-depth, research-driven, and visually layered examination that Everett Dance Theatre is known for. The company believes it can play a synthesizing role, looking at disparate elements and finding unexpected connections. As storytellers, they can translate technical information into affecting human stories. As humanists, they can anticipate and critique the social implications of technological advancements. Everett will seamlessly blend elements of choreography, storytelling, factual information, humor, and video projection, to create a multimedia dance/theater experience that informs, entertains and provokes thought. Educational programs such as public forums and lecture demonstrations will be developed alongside the performance, and will extend the dialogue to grade schools, universities and community settings wherever the show is performed.

STOMP AND CLAP

By The Learning Station
Lyrics:
(Follow the directions: Stomp and clap to the beat and repeat the nursery rhymes in unison.) 

""Alright, this song is called ""Stomp and Clap"". And that's exactly what we're going to do.
But first we're going to try it so follow me. Here we go!""

Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, clap. stomp, clap.
Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, clap. stomp, clap.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary.  (Mary, Mary, quite contrary.)
How does your garden grow?  (How does your garden grow?)
With silver bells and cockle shells.  (With silver bells and cockle shells.)
And all pretty maids in a row. (And all pretty maids in a row.)

Chorus: 
Put your hands down by your side and rest your feet.
(Rest your feet. You know you're going to rest your feet.)
Listen careful for the slide then start the beat, (start the beat), with your feet.
Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, clap. stomp, clap.
Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp, clap. stomp, clap.

Eeney, meeney, miney moe. (Eeney, meeney, miney moe.)
Catch a tiger by the toe.  (Catch a tiger by the toe.)
If he hollers let him go.  (If he hollers let him go.)
Eeney, meeney, miney moe. (Eeney, meeney, miney moe.)

Repeat chorus

Jack and Jill went up the hill.  (Jack and Jill went up the hill.)
To fetch a pale of water.  (To fetch a pale of water.)
Jack came down and broke his crown. (Jack fell down and broke his crown.)
And Jill came tumbling after.  (And Jill came tumbling after.)

Repeat chorus

Mary had a little lamb. (Mary had a little lamb.) 
It's fleece was white as snow. (It's fleece was white as snow.)
And everywhere that Mary went (And everywhere that Mary went) 
The lamb was sure to go. (The lamb was sure to go.) Repeat chorus (2x)

Nicole Avena explains why sweets and treats should be enjoyed in moderation.

Lyrics:
I went into the shop one day  
to get an ice cream treat
‘Cause ice cream is my favorite thing
my favorite thing to eat
So many different kinds to try
so many kinds to see
And when it was my turn to say
how many scoops for me…
I said, 1 scoop,1 scoop for me, please
1 scoop for me

I went into the shop one day  
to get an ice cream treat
‘Cause ice cream is my favorite thing
my favorite thing to eat
So many different kinds to try
so many kinds to see
And when it was my turn to say
how many scoops for me…
I said, 1 scoop, 2 scoops,
2  scoops for me, please
2 scoops for me

I went into the shop one day  
to get an ice cream treat
‘Cause ice cream is my favorite thing
my favorite thing to eat
So many different kinds to try
so many kinds to see
And when it was my turn to say
how many scoops for me…
I said, 1 scoop, 2 scoops, 3 scoops.
3 scoops for me, please
3 scoops for me

I went into the shop one day  
to get an ice cream treat
‘Cause ice cream is my favorite thing
my favorite thing to eat
So many different kinds to try
So many kinds to see
And when it was my turn to say
how many scoops for me…
I said, 1 scoop, 2 scoops, 3 scoops, 
4 scoops, 5 scoops, 6 scoops, 7 scoops,
8 scoops, 9 scoops, 10 scoops
10 scoops for me, please
10 scoops for me!

""President Donald Trump seemed poised to take responsibility for his failure on Covid-19 at Thursday’s presidential debate — and then he didn’t.
“I take full responsibility,” Trump said. He immediately continued: “It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault.”
It’s a big contradiction, but it’s emblematic of Trump’s approach to the coronavirus. Time and time again, Trump has tried to downplay the coronavirus and dodge responsibility, all while failing to embrace the kind of messaging and policy approach that experts recommend.
Asked about failures on testing early on, Trump said in March, “I don’t take responsibility at all.” Asked about the 1,000 Covid-19 deaths a day in the US at the time, Trump said in July, “It is what it is.”""

Our slow relaxing videos are especially created to relax and calm down kids and children who are in the classroom trying to learn and study. Teachers can put on this music after giving instructions while the students and are doing their work or reading. The music will focus childen and dissuade them from talking to each other while working. It can also be played for younger children during naptime and quiet reading & writing time. The music can also be used while students are listening to the teacher but just be sure to turn volume down even more during this time. The music can be used for any age including for preschoolers, elementary students, middle schoolers and children in kindergarten classrooms.

This relaxing kids music is intended to inspire kids to learn efficiently as they will be focused solely on working on their homework.  The music is also created with positivity in mind and keeps a perfect balance between being too relaxed and too awake. The music is composed at a slow relaxing tempo and is mixed at a low volume.  

To get the full impact of this quiet relaxation music put the music on at a relatively low volume. Be sure to place your stereo system in a way so that the music frequencies don't make any rattling sounds. Played to a young audience of inquiring minds this chill music will be the perfect learning aid for a tranquil and quiet classroom.  This music is fully instrumental and is 100% safe and clean for the school.

This calm music for kids is composed using the latest music creation technology. Soft tones and ambient sounds are melded together with beautiful piano, soft chilled out hand percussion sounds and high fidelity sampled synthesizers. This quiet time music for the classroom has also been tested in a French immersion classroom in Canada where a group of 25 grade two's listened to the music for every day for a week. In addition to the teacher reporting lower stress for herself she said that the students were better behaved, more positive in their interactions and generally more focused on learning while the music was playing. A number of students around the world have also tested the music at home as study music and have generally found it useful for them in making their study and homework time more enjoyable.

Lyrics:
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing, come on

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing

FAQ's:

Q: Who is Mr. Harry?
A: I am Pete Harry.  First name Pete.  Last name Harry.  I am the founder & content creator for Harry Kindergarten Music, LLC.  Check out ALL of my links at the bottom!   I am a full-time Kindergarten teacher in Bellwood, PA and live w/ my beautiful wife, Jen and 2 young children, Justice (daughter) & Paxton (son).

Q: When is my favorite Harry Kindergarten video coming back???????!!!!!!
A: I am slowly, but surely re-making most of my Harry Kindergarten videos.  If there was a particular video that you loved from several years ago and it's not  back up yet, be patient and it may re-appear in time!   As mentioned earlier, I am a full-time teacher, place a HIGH value on my family & values, and am extremely busy, so it might just take a little bit of time until you see your ""old favorite"" pop back up again.  Changing my kids' diapers and taking them to the playground comes before re-making videos, but if you are reallllllllllllly desperate, email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com or inquire at my Facebook group page and make a request so I have it on my radar screen.  I am NOT remaking old Jack Hartmann videos, but Jack IS and you can find those as HE remakes them and posts them at his YouTube page: www.youtube.com/jackhartmann.  

Q: Can my class perform a ""Harry Kindergarten song"" for an audience?
A: If you desire to have your class or group of students perform one of my “Harry Kindergarten” songs for an audience, please note that there is a $6.00 PERFORMANCE FEE.

Here are some hypothetical examples of performance groups:
* Students perform a song for an audience during a graduation ceremony.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school or community talent show.
* Students perform a song for an audience during a school assembly.
If you are unsure if you need to purchase a performance license or not, please inquire at: pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com.  If you want more details about using a song multiple years or multiple classes, etc., e-mail me for a detailed PDF file.  

$6.00 can be sent to:

Vernon struggled the first 20 years of his life trying to make sense of where he belonged and what he was going to do. Coming from an abusive and drug ridden household, Vernon was profoundly depressed, overweight with little self worth. He knew he wanted more, so he created the person you see and hear talking with you today. Starting with an understanding on being human, he learned from his grandmother and applied his educational background.

Kristina makes it SPOOKY and a bit CREEPY, but keeps the HALOOWEEN DANCE PARTY kid friendly where everyone, even the skeletons and witches, join in the FUN!

Halloween Dance Party is a great children’s Halloween song to celebrate the month of October and Halloween, but can also used as an October Brain Break activity anytime during the year.  The dance movements are all simple and easy to do, which really helps engage all children to participate, and keep the skeletons and witches busy too!

We made sure to make all of our characters Halloween friendly, but most importantly non-violent and not too scary for the little ones.

Go Bananas is  a wonderful brain breaks song your children can sing and move along with in the classroom, at home or at physical education. It is such a great brain breaks song because it's fun, easy and quick to do, and engages the children with lots of movement to get all those wiggles out.

Your children will love doing Go Bananas over and over again. This brain breaks song also has a positive message in it about how important fruits are for your physical and mental well being.

Children can follow my movements and be actively involved in all the actions for each fruit. (move arms like your forming the shape of the fruit, peeling the different fruit and having simple fun with all the other movements.)

Enjoy this brain breaks song through the whole year!

LYRICS:

Go Bananas

Form, form, form the banana
Peel, peel, peel the banana
Slice, slice, slice the banana
Go, Go, Go Bananas
Form, form, form the orange
Peel, peel, peel, the orange
Slice, slice, slice the orange
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the orange
Form, form, form the grapes
Pick, pick, pick the grapes
Stomp, stomp, stomp the grapes
Spread, spread, spread the jelly
Eat fruits every day, they help you work and play
They’re good for your skin and bones
And help you to grow
Fruits are so cool, you’ll do better at school
Go, Go, Go bananas, go!",Kids brain break,false

Children sing the chorus together with me, raise their arms up, hold hands and sway with friends as they sing about so many beautiful things all around.

It's my favorite and most requested good morning song. Both children and teachers love it's uplifting spirit and rhythm. The main portion of this good morning song is a repeat after me pattern.

The entire good morning song engages children in fun movements as they sing along so it engages their body and brain.

Lyrics:
A Beautiful Day  
Chorus Rise up children, celebrate, it’s a wonderful world and a beautiful day 
Hold a hand, swing and sway, it’s a wonderful  world and beautiful day  
(children answer all parts) 
Birds are flying Squirrels are climbing 
Trees are swaying 
Children are playing
 Runners are running 
Hearts are thumping 
Dancers are hopping 
Rabbits are hopping

Buses are driving 
Jets are flying 
Guitars are strumming 
Friends are hugging 
Tails are wagging
 Hands are clapping 
Fish – ees are swishing
 Mommies are kissing

The Penguin Dance uses a growing pattern to teach left and right, following directions, listening skills and develops gross motor movement skills.  We mirror left and right sides to make it easy to follow.  

Brain research suggests that physical activity like engaging in my fun movements songs like Penguin Dance, increases a student’s ability to process and retain new material.

I think brain breaks should be fun! Parent, teachers and kids all love the Penguin Dance.

Brain Breaks including songs like the Penguin Dance help your children rejuvenate and re-focus on learning.

During this video, students are expected to choose a dance move that is shown on the screen (this or that). Each dance slide will last for 25 seconds before changing. The music in the video will motivate and inspire your students. You can also encourage your students to simply dance along with their very own groovy style!!

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

I put a new twist on this favorite children's song with fun characters (surfers, Hip-Hop singers) and creative silly movements (yucky style, spooky ghost style).

Boom Chicka Boom is a wonderful ""repeat after me"" song can be used not only as a brain break in the classroom, but in physical education classes to get students moving and having fun.

In addition to using this for your brain breaks, Boom Chicka Boom highlights another educational skill, phonological awareness (reading skill)! All the ending sounds in Boom Chicka Boom sound alike except for Yo at the end. The yo was just for fun because children really like the pose.

James, my music partner, and I made the music in this version really rock! Your children will love the cool music and great beat to my new version of Boom Chicka Boom!

I'm so happy to this song and video to your children and we thought it was important to include a beautiful diversity of children. They had lots of fun shooting this video, Boom Chicka Boom.

Brain Breaks can be enjoyed in the classroom, physical education classes or at home! Watch Boom Chicka Boom again to really get those wiggles out!

Tap your feet, clap your hands to the rhythm
Nod your head, touch your nose, bend your knees

Sway your hips, turn around
Reach your hands to the ground
And jump to the Body Boogie with me
Verse 2
Click your fingers in time to the music
Shrug your shoulders and grin with your teeth
Chorus 2
Throw your hands in the air
Close your eyes if you dare
And jump to the Body Boogie with me

Move your feet, move your arms, sway your hips and your knees
Move your head, move your shoulders and grin with your teeth
Chorus 2
Throw your hands in the air
Close your eyes if you dare
And jump to the Body Boogie with me
Chorus 1
Sway your hips, turn around
Reach your hands to the ground
And dance to the Body Boogie with me

LYRICS:
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Stand up tall, find a friend, and stick out your right hand.
Firmly shake and look them in the eye…
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? It’s a great day. 
I’m thankful to be with you.
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? 
I’m happy to (feel this way).- 3x
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Close your hand with your knuckles facing at a friend.
Now you both tap knuckles as you smile….
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? It’s a great day. 
I’m thankful to be with you.
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? 
I’m happy to (feel this way).- 3x
There is something fun we can do when we meet.
Some are silly, some are proper ways to greet.
Right hand, to a friend’s right hand, then lock your thumbs.
Flutter up and do the butterfly…
Turn your head from side to side, 
Give a silly, almost proper sideways, HI!
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? It’s a great day. 
I’m thankful to be with you.
Good morning! Buenos Dias! What’s up? 
I’m happy to (feel this way).- 3x

LYRICS:
(Activity: This is a repeat after me song. Follow the actions for the song. Have fun rhyming as you do the action and dance moves.)

The Princess Pat lived in a tree. She sailed across the seven seas.  She sailed across the channel, too. 
And she brought with her, a rick-a-bamboo. A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat. It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 
Now, Captain Jack had a mighty fine crew. They sailed across the channel, too. 
But their ship sank and yours will too, if you don’t take a rick-a-bamboo. 
A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat.  
It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 

The Princess Pat saw Captain Jack. She reeled him in and brought him back.  
She saved his life and his crew, too. Do you know how?  
With a rick-a-bamboo. A rick-a-bamboo, now what is that?  It’s something made by the Princess Pat.  
It’s red and gold and purple, too. That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo. 
That’s why it’s called a rick-a-bamboo.

Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

Square Dance Cadence
From the CD, Kid’s Country Song & Dance
by The Learning Station
℗© Monopoli/The Learning Station
Lyrics:
SQUARE DANCE CADENCE 
(Follow the directions, repeat each line, and answer YEA! in the choruses.)

Stand up straight make a country line.
We’re all spruced up and looking fine.
Ya’ll do what I do and say what I say,
Country square dance, HIP HURRAY!
March in place and groove to the beat.
Clap and stomp your country feet.
Swing your lasso overhead.                                                                                                                                                                  Bring it down, now put it to bed.

Chorus: Can you feel it?-YEA! Can you do it?-YEA!
You want more?- YEA! Square Dance till the cows come home.

Turn and face your partner friend.
Shake their hand and bow your head.
Now do-se-do and holler “Yay!”
Get on your horse and gallop away.
Stand in place and clap along.
Twiddle your thumbs to this song.
Girls all curtsy, boys please bow.
Tip your hat, wag your tail like a cow. 

Chorus: Can you feel it?-YEA! Can you do it?-YEA!
You want more?- YEA! Square Dance till the cows come home.

Bend your knees up and down.
Wiggle your shoulders all around.
Fiddle your banjo strings real fast.
Stomp one boot to the YEEHA BLAST!
Stand up straight, arms by your side.
Rock back and forth, like a PONY RIDE!
Swing your lasso shout YAHOO!
Climb off your horse and dust your shoe.
Hands on your waist, flap em’ around

Move with Jack and build brain and body connections in this patterning
 video. 
Researchers say that when children explore and learn about patterns, we help them build important foundations for later number work. Creating, extending, naming, and talking about patterns help build strong mathematicians. Patterns are at the heart of math. The ability to recognize and create patterns help us make predictions based on our observations; this is an important skill in math. Understanding patterns help prepare children for learning complex number concepts and mathematical operations.
We find patterns in math, but we also find patterns in nature, art, music, and literature. Researchers have found that understanding and being able to identify recurring patterns allow us to make educated guesses, assumptions, and hypothesis; it helps us develop important skills of critical thinking and logic. The knowledge and understanding of patterns can be transferred into all curriculum areas.

Go Bananas
From the CD, #1 Best Kid's Songs
by The Learning Station
℗© Monopoli/The Learning Station
Lyrics:

(Repeat each line and perform each movement with your hands and body.)
 
Form, form, form the banana. Peel, peel, peel the banana. (Form the banana by
holding your arms out straight to your side and then slowly bring them up until they
are over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.
 
Slice, slice, slice the banana. Go, go, go bananas. Go bananas! (Pretend you are
slicing with a knife and go bananas with a crazy dance.)
 
Form, form, form the potato. Peel, peel, peel the potato. (Form the potato by holding
your arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they
meet over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Slice, slice, slice the potato. Mash, mash, mash the potato. Now mash! (Pretend you
are slicing with a knife and then mash by stomping your feet.)
 
Form, form, form the orange. Peel, peel, peel the orange. (Form the orange by holding
your arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they
meet over your head. Peel it by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Slice, slice, slice the orange. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the orange. (Pretend you
are slicing with a knife. For squeeze you can either hug the person next to you or
pretend you are squishing an orange between both of your hands.)
Now squeeze!
 
Form, form, form the guitar. Play it like a rock star. (Pretend you are playing a guitar.)
Jump, jump like a rock star. Rock, rock, rock the guitar. Now rock! (Jump up and down
and rock out with your pretend guitar)
 
Form, form, form the corn. Shuck, shuck, shuck the corn. (Form the corn by holding
your arms out straight to your side and then slowly bring them up until they are over
your head. Shuck by bringing them back down to your side.)
 
Cut, cut, cut the corn. Now, pop, pop, pop the corn. Now pop! (Pretend you are
scraping the kernels off the corn and then jump around the room like popping
popcorn.)
 
Form, form, form a big ball. Kick, kick, kick the big ball. (Form the ball by holding your
arms out to your side, elbows slightly bent and slowly bring them up until they meet
over your head. Pretend to drop the ball and kick it.)                                                                                                                                        
 
Throw, throw, throw the big ball. Bounce, bounce, bounce the big ball. (Using both
hands pretend to throw a big ball and then jump up and down like a bouncing ball.)
Now bounce!
Repeat 1st verse

It features some of the most popular Halloween characters; Frankenstein’s monster, ghosts, witches, spiders and vampires.  They’re all doing their own special dances that young children and big children can join in and dance along with.

Halloween Dance Party is a great children’s Halloween song to celebrate the month of October and Halloween, but can also used as an October Brain Break activity.  The dance movements are all simple and easy to do, which really helps engage all children to participate. 
Physical education classes could also use Halloween Dance Party as an October P.E. activity, especially for the primary students.

We made sure to make all of our characters Halloween friendly, but most importantly non-violent and not too scary for the little ones.

I wrote the song especially for Halloween and to celebrate Fall and the month of October.  Teachers, home schoolers and parents can use Halloween Dance Party to teach about the calendar and the season of Fall.

All of us here at Jack Hartmann’s Hop 2 It Music hope children, teachers, parents and families have lots of fun and enjoy dancing and celebrating Halloween.

Lyrics:

⭐️NOTES:  All my follow along workout videos are in 2 PARTS:

 1. Every workout video has an INTRODUCTION section first.
 2. And each ColorFit Workout begins when you see my ‘Sessions Timer Bar’ pop up above my head.

⭐️WHAT ARE COLORFIT WORKOUTS?

My ColorFit Workouts are color co-ordinated and numbered fitness routines for beginners to advanced ability levels designed to make choosing workouts simple and quick. You will get stronger, leaner and fitter, feel happier and more energized and boost your immune system naturally the more of these workouts you do. These online classes allow you to pick up some health tips, workout with me at your home or in a gym and many times the workouts are equipment free. They're all designed and recorded as real time workouts and are not 'highlights' but full length workouts to follow along with. These fast exercise programs are perfect hotel workouts and apartment friendly and some are low to no impact.

During this video, students are expected to follow the movement instructions that are shown on the screen. Each movement activity will last for 30 seconds before changing. The music in the video will motivate and inspire your students.  
Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

Learning basic phonics, holidays, manners, mathematics, shapes, colors, nursery rhymes through engaging music is what you will find here at ""BlackBerry Jam Kids Music"". 

Education is the key to success. The main purpose of this channel is to provide a stimulating online learning environment for kids of all ages. 
A learning environment that encourages community,  acts as a guide for parents and promotes the individual skills as well as confidence in each child.

Throughout my teaching experience, I have found that children earn best when actively engaged and provided with multiple forms of instruction. When children make connections to past experiences they will not only retain information longer, but they will also master material and become more confident in their own abilities.

I am excited to provide an enriched educational experience to children from all over the world.",Kids brain break,false

Children sing and count to 10 with me in auditory pattern, and then sing and count to 10 five times, but as five different fun characters. 

They pretend with me to be a soldier, an opera singer, a monster, a cowboy/ cowgirl and a baby. I try to make this count to 10 song even more fun in this video by dressing up as all five different characters. 

Children follow me pretending to be the characters and count to 10 as they use their own creativity to move and act like the characters too.

They visually see all the numbers 1 to 10 as we all sing together so this helps your children identify and remember the numerical symbols for counting 1 to 10.

When I sing this song ""live"" in concert all the children simply love it! All the smiles and laughter from teachers and parents show they love it too. This count to 10 song will soon be a favorite to do during brain breaks or as part of your regular basic math curriculum on counting and numbers.

I always love performing it too. I wrote it in 2010, but still love singing it to children just as much today.

Could bread protect an egg if I drop it?

I bet three slices would nicely stop it 
EXPERIMENT: try it out!
I had to drop a lot of eggs
ANALYZE: 
I can keep the egg safe
with five slices of bread!

The Singing Walrus presents ""Wash Your Hands"" - a fun, motown inspired song that encourages young children to get in the habit of washing their hands. Teachers will appreciate this during the winter time, when flu season is in full effect! 

Mother Hen leads the chicks through all the steps to properly wash your hands. This song is perfect for both native English speakers and young learners of ESL/EFL.

Here are the lyrics:

Wash Your Hands Song

(Chorus)
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Everybody come along and wash your hands! (repeat)

(Verse 1)
Show me, show me your hands, everybody
Show me, show me your hands - are they dirty?
Show me, show me your hands everybody
Time to wash your hands

Rub, rub, rub your hands, everybody
Rub, rub, rub your hands - are they soapy?
Rub, rub, rub your hands, everybody
Time to wash your hands

(Chorus)
And we sing 
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Everybody come along and wash your hands! (repeat)

(Verse 2)
Dry, dry, dry your hands, everybody
Dry, dry, dry your hands - are they dry yet?
Dry, dry, dry your hands, everybody
Time to wash your hands

Shake, shake, shake your hands, everybody
Shake, shake, shake your hands - are they clean now?
Shake, shake, shake your hands, everybody
Time to wash your hands

(Chorus)
And we sing 
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Everybody come along and wash your hands! (repeat)

Dancing 2’s helps students to learn to count to 100 as they skip count by 2’s. To make this a brain-based math activity, have the students hold up two fingers on each hand. As they count by 2’s they should sweep their right hand over to the left side of their body and then back again, doing the same from left to right. Crossing the mid-line (middle) of their body helps to encourage strong development of left brain/right brain communication. Another benefit is strengthening muscle coordination, which can support the development of fine motor skills such as writing numbers and drawing shapes.

Dancing 2's

Let me introduce you to the Dancing 2’s
They make you dance right to the groove.

Lyrics:

Oh, Old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own
He had a yellow cat that wouldn’t leave his home
He tried and he tried to give the cat away
He gave it to a man going far, far away

But the cat came back, the very next day
Oh, the cat came back
(they thought he was a goner)
but the cat came back, he just couldn’t stay
Away away away
MEOW!

So he gave it to a woman going
Up in a balloon
He told her for to take it to the
Man up in the moon
The balloon came down about
90 miles away
and where the woman is now,
well I cannot say

But the cat came back, the very next day
Oh, the cat came back
(they thought he was a goner)
but the cat came back, he just couldn’t stay
Away away away
MEOW

So he gave it to a man going way out West
he told him for to take it to the one he loved the best
first the train hit the track,
and then it jumped the rail
and nobody was left to tell the awful tale

But the cat came back, the very next day
Oh, the cat came back
(they thought he was a goner)
but the cat came back, he just couldn’t stay
Away away away

The cat came back, the very next day
Oh, the cat came back
(they thought he was a goner)
but the cat came back, he just couldn’t stay
Away away away

MEOOOOOOOW!

Here is our latest Halloween Song ""Zombie Walk."" This one tells the story of two zombies who are out for a night time walk, but can't help noticing that something is missing! 

The song is a simple chant to sing along, even for young kids and early learners of English. Teachers can make up more verses by adding more body parts and different Halloween creatures. The song can be used as a great basis for a fun Halloween role play in the classroom!


Video summary:

In the first verse, a zombie girl goes out for a stroll, but notices that her arm is missing. The owl tells her that the witch has her arm, down by the cemetery gate. When the zombie finds the witch at the end of the verse, she has a funny surprise for the witch!  :)

In the second verse, a zombie man notices that his hair is missing while he is out for a walk. The owl tells him that a ghost has his hair, down by the cemetery gate. When the zombie finds the ghost wearing his hair, he lets the ghost know that the hair is full of dirt!

Here are the lyrics:

(Verse 1 Part 1)
I walk and walk the Zombie walk 2x
I walk and walk - but wait! 2x

I lost my arm, my lovely arm 2x
Somewhere along the way! 2x

Whoo says the owl, who did this who? 2x
The witch did this to you 2x
Down by the cemetery gate!

Hee hehe hee hee 3x
Boo!


(Verse 1 Part 2)
I walk and walk the Zombie walk 2x
I walk back all the way 2x

I see the witch, the wicked, wicked witch 2x
Down by the cemetery gate! 2x

Hey you, I say, come out 2x
Give back my arm, my lovely arm 2x
Or I’ll take yours, I shout. 

Hee hehe hee hee 3x
Boo!

(Verse 2 Part 1)
I walk and walk the Zombie walk 2x
I walk and walk - but wait! 2x

I lost my hair, my lovely hair 2x
Somewhere along the way! 2x

Whoo says the owl, who did this who? 2x
The ghost did this to you 2x
Down by the cemetery gate!

Hoo hoho hoo hoo 3x
Boo!

(Verse 1 Part 2)
I walk and walk the Zombie walk 2x
I walk back all the way 2x

I see the ghost, the goofy, goofy ghost 2x
Down by the cemetery gate! 2x

Hey you, I say, hey you! 2x
Give back my hair, my lovely hair 2x
It's full of dirt, it's true!

I'm a very hungry caterpillar crawling around eating everything in sight that can be found.
I'm weaving a cocoon on a good size twig and I'm starting to get real big.
I'm eating so much you can hear me chew.
Chomp, chomp, chomp's all I want to do so much that I just can't stop.
I'm afraid that I might pop!
POP
I'm a butterfly flying about.
I'm beautiful, I want to twist and shout. HEY!
A butterfly, it's a brand new day and I still hear my little friends say:
Repeat verse
I'm a very hungry caterpillar crawling around, I'm a butterfly.

""Hungry Caterpillar"" is a fun spring activity song where children sing, dance and play along as they learn about the metamorphosis of the caterpillar to a butterfly.  Music combined with movement makes learning about the season's fun for kids.  Also perfect for English as a second language (ESL) children's learning programs.

One of the most powerful and effective reading strategies is sight word recognition. Sight word recognition is recognizing by sight the words that appear with high frequency in books and texts .
Sight words are also called high frequency words.  Sight words are encouraged to be learned  as a whole, by sight, so students automatically recognize these sight words without the need to decode or sound them out.  Sight word recognition contributes to fluency in reading.
This sight word song includes the following sight words;and, at, to, for, the, are, is and was.
The first time through spell and say the word with Jack.  The second time spell the word with Jack and students say the word independently.  The  third time students spell and say the word independently and then say the sight word three times for practice.

℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
Up on the house-top, reindeer paws. Out jumps good old Santa Claus.
Down through the chimney, lots of toys, all for little girls and boys.
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go? Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go?
Oh, up on the house-top, click, click, click.
Down through the chimney, with Good St. Nick.

Thank you to everyone that voted in the poll!

This is the first Spot the difference Brain Games video where I put myself on the video. I'm a bit nervous (you won't believe how many times I had to shoot the introduction), but please bear with me. I really want to get Detormentis back on track. The developments of the last few months has really placed a strain on how my channel looks. 

I have always intended this to be a fun channel for kids, but unfortunately I have been toeing the line (completely oblivious, no excuse) on what is permitted. The emoji's used in this video has been self created, so hopefully going forward I can offer you guys 100% compliant content. I just want to stick to making the content you guys enjoy, and that I am comfortable with.

Anyways, enough of my rambling. I hope you enjoy the video. There are 10 picture puzzles for you to complete, each one with ONE difference. You get about 15 seconds to complete each challenge! Have fun, and don't forget to subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5MgQS6VbE9DOwi-R5Vh6w.

Favourite action songs for toddlers and preschoolers from kindyRock - great songs for kids!

☆☆☆
Top 10 best ever children's action song, ""Muddy Clothes""! Is a huge favourite song with preschoolers and toddlers. It’s a fun, action song for children that they love to sing and dance along to.  It's a super easy song to sing along to and also super easy as an action and movement song for kids. We are so grateful that this has been made with the support of NZ on Air! Thanks, we are sure all the little kids who love to sing will be so happy.

Kids love to sing and dance and move along with action songs just for children.  Muddy Clothes  is the best song to get your children performing, with actions and movement to suit every child’s ability.

Sing along with kindyRock creator Judi Cranston as she takes you through simple actions, telling the story of a washing machine song, washing, spinning. Flapping and jumping. The tempo gets faster making this so much fun to sing along to. Help your children to be creative by showing them how to make up their own actions, learn new language and of course TO HAVE FUN! Children love to sing and dance to their own songs as well as kindyRock songs.

If you have landed on this Youtube channel it’s probably because you are a teacher to children aged under 7 years, you've heard about us through a school, kindergarten, daycare, yoga or music class, you're an in home educator or a parent who understands the importance of music education for children's development.  

At kindyRock we want to help support you in your teaching by providing you with Quality Music Education Resources.

As a teacher you will probably know how important and effective music is for our children’s brains and that you should be doing music regularly, even on a daily basis in your classes! If you don't feel comfortable singing, that's where we make it easy for you, guiding you and the children through these easy to remember songs, designed to support you and their learning needs.

Your children will love using their voices to sing , their hands to do the actions and their eyes to follow along with Judi Cranston. Your kids will have a blast with this exciting, silly and fun song! You can incorporate and encourage your children to join in which also helps them with rhythm and is perfect for brain breaks, circle time, group activities or those bad weather days when children can't go outside to play.

'Muddy Clothes' is also easy and fun to play or pretend to play when you need a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh, they can then return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realising the significant values of breaks like this in the classroom.

Muddy yes they are x 3 
Muddy, muddy, muddy yes they are.

How can I get them clean?
Put them in the washing machine!

My clothes are washing, washing, washing, washing, washing yes they are x 3
Washing, washing, washing yes they are.
Oh, no, they’re much too wet! I can’t put them on just yet. 

My clothes are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning yes they are x 3
Spinning, spinning, spinning yes they are
How can I get them dry? Hang them on the washing line.
 
My clothes are flapping, flapping,...yes they are x 3 
Flapping, flapping, flapping yes they are.
Now it’s such a lovely day. I’m gonna go outside and play. 
There’s a puddle, jump right in.
Oh, no, my clothes are muddy again!

Our song features three important social-emotional learning concepts - Be Happy, Be Proud, Be You!  This song touches each and everyone of us - children, adults, everyone. We encourage teachers and caregivers to have those you are working with change up the lyrics and add things THEY may like - this creates a feeling of belonging and encourages inclusiveness.

Lyrics:

I - like - singing in the rain
I - like - whistling in the dark
I - like - running up a hill
Most of all I like - being me

I - like - starring at the moon
I - like reading in my room
I - like - flowers when they bloom
Most of all I like - being me

I like lots of things
I like having fun
I like being happy
I like being me

I - like - leaves when they fall
I - like - snowflakes floating down
I - like - swimming in a pool
Most of all I like - being me

I like lots of things
I like having fun

Boys and girls, use your eyes, your ears, your hands and your brain
Science is everywhere, everyday
Plants are growing

Rivers are flowing

Birds are flying

Whales are diving

It's a world of wonder
It's a world of wonder
See the stars shine bright
See the stars shine bright
It's a world of wonder
It's a world of wonder
Rockets blast up high
Rockets blast up high

Dark clouds are forming
Dark clouds are forming
Rain is falling

Lightning is flashing

Thunder is crashing

It's a world of wonder
It's a world of wonder
See the stars shine bright

Big gorillas are stomping

It's a world of wonder
It's a world of wonder
See the stars shine bright
See the stars shine bright
It's a world of wonder
It's a world of wonder
Rockets blast up high
Rockets blast up high

Science is cool for me and you
Learning how things work and what they do
Use your 5 senses everyday
Observe all around as you work and play

Engage your brain and body with cross lateral exercises as you count to cross the brain mid-line and build body and brain connections as you count to 120 by 5's. Crossing the mid-line (middle) of their body helps to encourage strong development of left brain/right brain communication. Another benefit is strengthening muscle coordination, which can support the development of fine motor skills such as writing numbers and drawing shapes.

Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.

YouTube Tags: brain science, brain, stroke, neuroplasticity, science, motor learning, identity, TED, TEDxVancouver, TEDxVancouver 2015, Vancouver, TEDx, Rogers Arena, Vancouver speakers, Vancouver conference, ideas worth spreading, great idea,

Our knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. 

Dr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility.

Subitize is the ability to tell the number of objects in a set, quickly, without counting.  In this subitizing song  name the numbers in each set of objects, ten frames, five frames and tally marks. Subitizing develops math fluency, when students recognize sets without having to count each object and it helps develop number sense and the ability to perform mental math. In this version we subitize up to 5 and then give the answer for reinforcement. Have fun subitizing with this subitize song.

GET SMARTER SECTION:
A quick clarification....
It took me 8 months to learn how to do this, but I was only picking up the bike and running to the end of the driveway and back every day.  I wasn't ""ACTIVELY"" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.

Do not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.  That's simply not true.

This number pairs song engages students to demonstrate the number bonds for 7 with their fingers for active engagement and strengthening  brain and body connections.  Number pairs are all the different combinations of numbers that compose a specific number. The concept of number bonds is very basic, an important foundation for understanding how numbers work. A whole thing is made up of parts.  Learn all  the  different number pairs that add up to 7. Number pairs for 7 can also be called friends of 7, number bonds for 7 and partners of 7. Knowing number pairs for 7 builds math fluency for addition and subtraction.

Lyrics
Let's learn our number pairs

Maybe you are a teacher who needs ideas for exercises? 

Movement or sensory breaks are an essential part of the school-day however some children require them more frequently with specific activities completed which have been recommended by an OT. Here are some of my top picks of exercises to be completed during movement breaks. 

The activities you'll find on my channel are more than just fun ideas, they help develop a child's fine and gross motor skills which are so important to work on at a younger age! Many of the crafts are used by Occupational Therapists during Occupational Therapy Sessions.

I combined these two loves and created Rock Out Tooty Ta. We had a lot of fun recording and shooting this version of Tooty Ta.

Children follow the movements and add a new one each time we sing Tooty Ta. This song is great for brain breaks. Teachers can do the song in the classroom and physical education teachers can have kids dance and sing the Tooty Ta in the gym or outdoor in the fresh air.

Tooty Ta helps children with following directions as the song is a growing pattern. Kids have to listen for the new action for the dance and then have to repeat after me what I say.

Children love my yellow rock guitar, so I put it in the video so children can imagine they're playing one too as they rock out to Tooty Ta.

Physical activity can prevent depression and learned helplessness by acting on the serotonin circuits. 
Get up and move! Emotional states are called “action sets” because they prepare us to act in certain ways. When we feel good on the inside, we learn better and act better on the outside. Let’s Boogie! 
(Everyone sing the first verse in unison. During the Chorus touch your head, your feet, then shake, shout and rock to the beat. Follow the directions in each verse and keep doing that same 
movement throughout the Refrains.) 
LYRICS:
Blues, blues go away. We want to sing and dance today.
Blues, blues go away. Brain Boogie Boosters are here to stay.
[Chorus] Get the brain boogie rockin’ beat 
From your head, down to your feet. 
Everybody wiggle, shake and shout. Yeah!
That’s what this boogie song is all about.
Hold your arms up way high.
Cross your hands up in the sky.
Cross your ankles, bend your knees,
Wiggle down to the beat.
[Refrain] Wiggle down-Wiggle up-Wiggle down-Wiggle up
Shake it left-Shake it right-Shake it left-Shake it right
We clap to the beat. We step with our feet.
Brain boogie rockin’ is really neat.
[Repeat Chorus]
Left hand to right toe, right hand to left toe
Twice as fast, now touch and go
Left and right, to and fro 
[Repeat Refrain]
[Repeat Chorus]
Hold your arms down by your sides. 
Jump up and down but not too high. Cross your arms behind your back. Now, jump just like a jumping jack. [Repeat Refrain]

C'MON LET'S DANCE 3:11
This song contains a collection of Fad, Craze or Novelty style dances. Dance style fads have always been a part of social dancing.
Now it's your turn to be creative, get silly, have fun and make-up your very own movement for each dance that Deejay Don calls
out.
Chorus:
C'mon let's dance. There's so many dances we can't count them all.
C'mon let's dance. We'll make up our own and we'll have a ball.
Do The Peek-a-boo, do The Karate Monkey, do The Tickle Yourself,
Now, Tip Toe Through The Tulips. Repeat Chorus
Do the Jiggling Jell-O, do the Frankenstein Monster Walk,
Now, do The Milkshake, now do The Bunny Hop.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Hula Hoop, do The Popping Popcorn,
Now, do The Chicken Little, now do The Leap Frog.
Now do The Tie Yourself In A Knot, do The Q-tip, The Cat's Got Your Tongue,
now do The Spin, do The Falling Leaf, do The Cell Phone.
(The following is an actual conversation from On Star)
Phone rings: Hello -- Hello, yea, I'd like to order a couple pizzas. Uh, no this not a pizza place. What is it then? We're doing a
song here. The C'mon Let's Dance.? Yea, yea, that's the song. By The Learning Station? Exactly. How's it go? It goes...
Repeat Chorus
Do The Stretch, do The Windshield Wiper, the Mosquito Bite, now do The Hopscotch.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Slip And Slide, do The Helicopter, do The Sprinkler, now do The Toaster.
Repeat Chorus (3X)

Why take brain breaks?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing children to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  These songs are ideal for toddlers, preschoolers and elementary age children.

This Alphabet song in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the consonant d

Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they’ll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say the letter and its sound as a beginning and ending sound with a variety of storytelling words.

This letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.
All of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.
Your children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the consonant sound at the beginning and at the end of each word.

Listening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  
The very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.
And, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.  



Lyrics:
Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet  
26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet
    
Let’s learn about the letter D
D is a letter, d is a letter, d is a letter
D is a letter in the alphabet
This is an uppercase D, write it in the air like this
This is an uppercase D, write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase d, write it in the air like this
This is a lowercase d, write it in the air like this

Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet

Letter d is a consonant and it has a sound
Letter d is a consonant and it has a sound
I say the d sound /d/  -  /d/ /d/ /d/ /d/
Now you say the d sound /d/  -  /d/ /d/ /d/ /d/

At the beginning of these words
Listen for the d sound /d/
One day my dog, dog, dog
Met a duck, duck, duck
Who loved to dance, dance, dance
And do the disco, disco, disco

At the end of these words
Listen for the d sound /d/
I knew a kid, kid, kid
Who’s shirt was red, red, red
All day he’d fish in the pond, pond, pond
Then at night go to bed, bed, bed

It’s fun to learn about the alphabet
And I’m really gonna’ try and do my best
Learn each letter, learn each sound
Learn how to write each letter down
I feel so good deep inside
I’m proud I’m learning, to read and write

Get ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet  
26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet

Lyrics: 
Don’t Read Like A Robot

So I was chillin in class, mindin my biz
When my teacher, she calls on me
She says, Alright it's your turn to read aloud! 
And like an icy POP! I freeze   (BRRRR!)
WHEN I open my mouth to speak the words
my tongue is in a knot
Do I read with expression? Not even close.
I sound like a robot.
Did you know that tigers have striped skin, not just striped fur?

And my teacher said...
FLIP A SWITCH AND READ IT LIKE THISSSSSS… 

Did you know that tigers have striped skin, not just striped fur?
Did you know that tigers have striped skin, not just striped fur? 

Got it!
 
You gotta read with expression
Yes, read with expression
You wanna read with expression
Don’t read like a robot

Next day I was loungin’ in my room  
And my mom knocked right on my door 
She said “ You got a letter from gramps 
He’s with grams in El Salvador!”
I went to read the letter to myself 
But my mom opened up her lips
She said “why not read that letter out loud” 
I wanna hear about their trip!
Hello Sonny! We’re having a blast! Grandma and I went skydiving! 

And my mom said…
FLIP A SWITCH AND READ IT LIKE THISSSSSS… 

Hello Sonny! We’re having a blast! Grandma and I went skydiving! 
Hello Sonny! We’re having a blast! Grandma and I went skydiving! 

You gotta read with expression
Yes, gotta read with expression
You wanna read with expression
Don’t read like a robot

At school the next day, I tried out for the play
And I really wanted the main part (really really)
I practiced the lines over over again
I was nervous, oh man, my heart (thump, thump)
When it was my turn on stage to read for the role
All the blood rushed to my head
My tongue twisted up and knees started to shake
You couldn’t hear a word I said!
I'm sitting on a tack!  I'm sitting on a tack! Ahh! Help! I'm sitting on a tack!

And my director said…
FLIP A SWITCH AND READ IT LIKE THISSSSSS… 

I'm sitting on a tack!  I'm sitting on a tack! Ahh! Help! I'm sitting on a tack!
I'm sitting on a tack!  I'm sitting on a tack! Ahh! Help! I'm sitting on a tack!

You gotta read with expression
Yes gotta read with expression
C’mon read with expression
Don’t read like a robot

Now when I read anything out loud 
I do it with passion and flare
No more mumbly words and silly murmurs
I’m chill - not all crazy and scared 
I used to read like a ROBOT 
ROBOT VOICE: All my words sounded exactly the same 
But now I read with expression
Yo! That’s my claim to fame!

I read with expression
Oh yeah I read with expression
I like to read with expression
I Don’t read like a robot

You gotta read with expression
Yes read with expression
C’mon read with expression
Don’t read like a robot

Anybody want a peanut?
I’ll take it!",Kids brain break,true

This cool kid-friendly song starts out with a message about staying healthy and fit and having fun counting to 100 together.   It's a great count to 100 song for Kindergarten.
I show the children simple, easy to do exercises for each 10 numbers. Children have a variety of gross motor movements to do as they count to 100. 
    The songs great beat and steady counting motivate children to keep moving all the way to 100. We show the numbers  from 1 to 100 very large and clear so children also get the visual number recognition and stimulation. 
    This count to 100 song will engage your children with the catchy up tempo music, the clear numeral visuals and seeing Jack sing and demonstrate the exercises.
     Use Count to 100 - Let's Get Fit every day to strengthen your children's ability to count to 100 and help them enjoy and have fun exercising  too.
     Counting to 100 and basic number recognition is a standard in most early childhood ( pre-k, K and 1st grade)  classrooms.
This is a great math song to start your day with, as a brain break or use it during indoor recess. 
    PE Teachers will love  Count to 100 too as it emphasizes physical education and aerobic exercise as children count to 100.

Students will glide like eagles as they are shown the eagle subtraction sentence to solve.  Students will swim like alligators as they are shown the alligator subtraction sentence to solve.  Students will run fast in place as they are shown the runner subtraction sentence to solve.  Students will  pretend to pump weights as they are shown the body builders subtraction sentence to solve.  Students are shown the whole set and then will be presented with a subtraction problem to find the difference.  Both objects and the subtraction fact will be shown on the screen.  Have fun acting out basic subtraction facts.  

This video reinforces the subtraction standards.
Represent and solve problems involving addition and subtraction.

CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.A.1
Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.

Lyrics
Subtraction action, this is how you play
Move your body and take away
When you subtract things you get the difference
Let's do subtraction, move and have fun

Four bald eagles are gliding in the air
Two bald eagles fly down and land somewhere
How many bald eagles are gliding in the air?
4 - 2 = 2

Three alligators are swimming in the lake
Two alligators go on the grass and take a break?
3 - 2 = 1

Ten fast runners are running in a race
Five fast runners finish at record pace
How many fast runners are running in the race?
10 - 5 = 5

Eight body builders are pumping up some weights
Five body builders stop and take a break
How many body builders are still pumping up some weights?
8 - 5 = 3

Subtraction action, this is how you play
Move your body and take away
When you subtract things you get the difference
Let's do subtraction, move and have fun

Wishy Washy Washer Woman
From the CD, ""#1 Best Kid's Songs""
by The Learning Station
℗© Monopoli/The Learning Station

Lyrics:
Wishy Washy Washer Woman 

(Stand up and move your hips side to side to the music. Sing along and do the motions in parenthesis.)

Way down in the valley where nobody goes, (Wag your index finger back and forth in front of you.) there's a wishy, washy washer woman washin' her clothes. 
(Pretend you are scrubbing up and down on a washboard in front of you.)

She goes, ""Ooh Ah, Ooh Ah."" 4x (Continue scrubbing up and down, and move your hips back and forth to each ""Ooh Ah."") That's how the wishy, washy washer woman washes her clothes. (Continue scrubbing up and down on a washboard.)

Hey, washer woman! Ooh Ah! Ooh Ah! Hey, washer woman! Ooh Ah! Ooh Ah!
(Begin with a big wave by bringing your right arm slowly across the sky from left to right, and then firmly move your hips back and forth. REPEAT.)

Way down in the valley where nobody goes, (Wag your index finger back and forth in front of you.) there's a wishy, washy washer woman dryin' her clothes. (Dry your clothes by blowing puffs of air.) She goes, ""Ooh Ah, Ooh Ah"" 4x (Continue drying your clothes by blowing puffs of air and move your hips firmly back and forth for each ""Ooh Ah."")

That's how the wishy, washy washer woman dries her clothes. (Continue drying your clothes.) Hey, washer woman! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Hey, washer woman! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! (Begin with a big wave by bringing your right arm across the sky and then firmly move your hips back and forth. REPEAT.)

Way down in the valley where nobody goes, (Wag your index finger back and forth in front of you.) there's a wishy, washy washer woman foldin' her clothes. 

(Fold by clapping your hands in front of you in a horizontal position.)
She goes, ""Clap, Clap."" 4x (Continue folding your clothes with horizontal claps.)
That's how the wishy, washy washer woman folds her clothes. (Continue folding.)

LYRICS:
Bye bye bye
I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye 
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
You just hit me with the truth
Now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on
I've lived for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone
I know that I can't take no more
Ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye 
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
I'm giving up I know for sure
don't' want to be the reason for your love no more
Bye bye
I'm checking out, I'm signing off
Don't want to be the loser and I've had enough
I don't want to be your fool in this game for two
So I'm leaving you behind
(Bye bye bye)
I don't want to make it tough
(Make it tough)
But I've had enough
(Bye bye)
And it ain't no lie

If your children love to dance and move this is a brain breaks song you'll want to use over and over again. 

It has a cowboy theme with very cool country Hip - Hop groove your children will just love. Your children will be engaged in movement and fun and singing ""Yipee yi ya"" all together. This brain breaks song has simple movements that repeat so children will easily learn this dance and move along.

Classroom teachers, PE teachers and parents can use this song to get children up and moving, having fun, and get a little break from their academic work. It's a brain breaks song that's really different with a cool cowboy theme.

LYRICS:

Yippee Yi Yo –Yippy Yi, Ya (3x)         Chorus
Do the Cowboy Dance this way

I've got my cowboy hat
I’ve got my cowboy boots
I love to sing and move
And do the Cowboy Dance with you

(children sing)

Now spread your feet out wide –wide
Point knees out to each side–side
Then bend knees up and down – down
Right to this cowboy sound – sound
Raise one arm up high – high
Your lasso in the sky
Ride your horse, take a chance
Lets all do the Cowboy Dance

Yippee Yi Yo –Yippy Yi, Ya (3x)
Do the Cowboy Dance this way

Repeat Dance Moves

Learn some new cowboy steps
Right foot out toe up, clap and stomp
Left foot out toe up, clap and stomp
Now, left foot out, quarter turn left,right foot stomp
Now, right foot out, quarter turn right,left foot stomp
Do it again, ride your horse
Do the Cowboy Dance once more

It's also great to perform anytime you or your little ones need to take a short time out to calm down. This routine is all about deep breathing and is a great way to open up the spine and stretch the torso. 

In this video I have tried to represent breathing in a new way by adding a blue ball in the bottom left hand corner. As the ball gets bigger, breathe in, as the ball gets smaller, breathe out. I hope it helps! As always, children will be able to grasp the movements and breathing patterns quicker if you perform the exercises with them. These exercises are excellent for adults as well!

This is currently my favourite breathing routine, I hope you and your little people enjoy it just as much!",Kids brain break,false

This song really makes rhyming fun which is so important in learning for young children. The ability to know when words rhyme is an essential listening and language skill for all children.  Many studies have shown that children who have developed their ability to know when words rhyme will have a better chance of becoming successful readers. Offering your children many opportunities to hear and practice rhyming will give them a better chance of becoming lifelong readers.
Make a Rhyme, Make a Move is a great song to use regularly to allow your children to really have   fun learning about rhyming.  This song presents two words, and children have a chance to listen and decide if the words rhyme or not. If the words rhyme then they do a cool Hip –Hop dance, and if the words don’t rhyme they get a chance to move and say - No way, no way.
 Listening for the parts of sounds in words at the beginning, middle and ending really helps children develop their phonological awareness (hearing the parts of words) skills so important in becoming a successful reader.
This song is so cool it will really help make learning about rhyming fun for all your children.
 Make a Rhyme, Make a Move includes Jack Hartmann and Rachel Smith singing together. Both Rachel and Jack show your children the different moves and dances they can do. And, this rhyming song features rhyming that is simple and easy to follow.
Studies show that having the ability to recognize and be aware of words that rhyme is a good predictor of future successful reading in the future.
Help make rhyming fun for your children and sing, dance and listen for those rhymes!

Lyrics:

Make a rhyme, make a move 
You can do it – I can too 

Chorus  

Make a rhyme, make a move Do it to the beat
Make a rhyme, make a move Have some fun with me  

When the two words rhyme make a move like this 
Two thumbs, crisscross, say that rhymes that rhymes 
When the words don’t rhyme make a move like this 
One arm out front, back and forth say no way, no way   

Cat - hat   that rhymes (2x)
 Dog – frog   that rhymes (2x) 
Can – mat  no way (2x) 
Pig – jig   that rhymes (2x) 
Boat – car   no way  (2x)
Silly – Willy   that rhymes (2x)

        Repeat Chorus  

Bug – hug   that rhymes (2x) 
Teacher – preacher  that rhymes (2x) 
House – truck   no way (2x)
 House – mouse  that rhymes (2x)
Tree – me   that rhymes (2x) 
Egg – chicken   no way (2x)

Why take brain breaks?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing children to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  
C'MON LET'S DANCE is a great brain breaks action, dance song to make it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh then they can return to their academics feeling happy, joyous, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realizing the significant values of brain breaks for both students and teachers. So take a break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. In the classroom this brain breaks dance song is perfect for the preschool and kindergarten.

C'MON LET'S DANCE
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
C'MON LET'S DANCE 3:11
This song contains a collection of Fad, Craze or Novelty style dances. Dance style fads have always been a part of social dancing.
Now it's your turn to be creative, get silly, have fun and make-up your very own movement for each dance that Deejay Don calls
out.
Chorus:
C'mon let's dance. There's so many dances we can't count them all.
C'mon let's dance. We'll make up our own and we'll have a ball.
Do The Peek-a-boo, do The Karate Monkey, do The Tickle Yourself,
Now, Tip Toe Through The Tulips. Repeat Chorus
Do the Jiggling Jell-O, do the Frankenstein Monster Walk,
Now, do The Milkshake, now do The Bunny Hop.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Hula Hoop, do The Popping Popcorn,
Now, do The Chicken Little, now do The Leap Frog.
Now do The Tie Yourself In A Knot, do The Q-tip, The Cat's Got Your Tongue,
now do The Spin, do The Falling Leaf, do The Cell Phone.
(The following is an actual conversation from On Star)
Phone rings: Hello -- Hello, yea, I'd like to order a couple pizzas. Uh, no this not a pizza place. What is it then? We're doing a
song here. The C'mon Let's Dance.? Yea, yea, that's the song. By The Learning Station? Exactly. How's it go? It goes...
Repeat Chorus
Do The Stretch, do The Windshield Wiper, the Mosquito Bite, now do The Hopscotch.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Slip And Slide, do The Helicopter, do The Sprinkler, now do The Toaster.
Repeat Chorus (3X)

No one knows
About your tippy toes

See how it feels
When you click your heels

I get loose

Just slide
You look fly
When you slide

As a Certified Nutritionist, she works with families, companies, and individuals helping them breakthrough the myths around diet and exercise and create a whole new and empowering Culture of Healthy Living.

She has helped thousands of people take back their health through her philosophy Small Change, Big Impact™.  With this simple, yet profound message, Julie dispels the negative beliefs about weight loss and eradicates the mindset that being healthy is hard.

And she should know.  Up until age 20 Julie battled with her weight.  Her own experience of growing up as the fat girl, and cycling through diet after diet gave her the drive to find a better way. She knows first-hand the heartache, and dangers, of eating junk food, leading a sedentary life and being overweight. 
 
Today, Julie lives a different life. She follows her systematic approach to eating right, exercise and practicing self-care and is committed to helping others do the same.

In her speaking and coaching programs Julie shares her systematic approach to break free from what she describes as the Fat Kid Mentality.   She helps her clients realize and breakthrough all of the limiting beliefs around food and what it really means to be healthy.

Her company, MaxLife Therapies, was inspired by her son Max, whose vibrant health and dynamic nature serve as reminders that nothing is static, and that we all have an inherent desire to create better outcomes for ourselves. It is Julie's strong belief that everyone has the ability to maximize vitality and longevity, and truly Live Your MaxLife™. 
 
She was recruited to be the Nutritional Coach for the TV documentary, Fitting In which aired on ABC Family in June 2008.   The show, currently being considered for national cable, is designed to educate viewers on the cause, effects and possible solutions for the growing epidemic of childhood obesity.  This is just one example of Julie's commitment to transforming one of our country's leading health issues.

Her educational DVD series Maxs Minutes: The A-Zs of Healthy Living, which she produced with 6-year-old Max, gives parents and kids a fun and unique look at how to create a healthy home.  Her new book, Fat is Not a Four Letter Word: 14 Daily Lessons to Break Through Your Fat Kid Mentality, debuts in 2010 and will transform how people approach dieting and weight loss by giving daily lessons for creating a healthier life.

Whether its personal consultation with adults or working with kids and parents in her MaxLife Family Wellness Programs, Julie implements her winning formula to Educate, Empower, and Explore™ - a proven step-by-step plan that guarantees results!

Her Corporate MaxLife Wellness Program is the most comprehensive and cost-effective wellness program available.  Companies can effectively support their employees' health goals, while drastically reducing the cost of healthcare and absenteeism due to stress and chronic illness.

Her newest program MaxLife Parents at Work, is specifically designed for busy parents in the workplace.  It takes the principles from her corporate programs, and customizes it to address the challenges that working parents face trying to stay well and raise healthy, happy kids in a busy world. 

Its about creating a CULTURE - so that eating right, exercising and other healthy habits become so much a part of who you are, that you do it without thinking about it!  

Julie is passionate about helping you Live Your MaxLife!",Kids brain break,true

Word families, sometimes called phonograms or chunks, can help emergent readers by providing predictable patterns within words.

When learning to read, patterns are important.  Children recognize word patterns and this makes it easier to sound out words. 

Sing and move with Jack as he introduces  word families that end with the  ""at"", ""ug"" and ""in"" patterns.

I'm a very hungry caterpillar crawling around eating everything in sight that can be found.
I'm weaving a cocoon on a good size twig and I'm starting to get real big.
I'm eating so much you can hear me chew.
Chomp, chomp, chomp's all I want to do so much that I just can't stop.
I'm afraid that I might pop!
POP
I'm a butterfly flying about.
I'm beautiful, I want to twist and shout. HEY!
A butterfly, it's a brand new day and I still hear my little friends say:
Repeat verse
I'm a very hungry caterpillar crawling around, I'm a butterfly.

""Hungry Caterpillar"" is a fun spring  song where children sing, dance and play along as they learn about the metamorphosis of the caterpillar to a butterfly.  Music combined with movement makes learning about the season's fun for kids.  Also perfect for English as a second language (ESL) children's learning programs.

On February 2nd it's Groundhog Day
When we see if the groundhog runs or stays
If he pops up and sees his shadow on the ground
They'll be 6 more weeks of winter then he drops back down

And every 4 years it's Leap Year and we add on one day of time
So we add the day to February and go from 28 days to 29

What month comes next after January?

Zero the Hero is a big strong character in our video here, but Zero the Hero can be anyone at your school that helps children understand that when you count; zero is so important because you can't count past 9 without a zero to hold the tens place, or two zeros the hold the hundreds place, or three zeros to hold the thousands place. 

We hope your children will have fun dancing, exercising and counting by 10's to 100 with Zero the Hero.

Our Zero the Hero featured in this video is a great guy and friend of mine named Mark. He's a big believer in healthy living, natural eating and working out, of course. We believe in fitness and exercise for all so follow Zero the Hero and celebrate 100 days of school!

The Wheels on the Bus (People on the Bus)
(Talk) I like to sing this song when I go for a ride with my mom. I sing it when I go on a field trip with my class. I sing it when I pretend I'm driving somewhere. Why don't we all sing it right now? YEAH!
The people on the bus go up and down, up and down, up and down. The people on the bus go up and down, all through the town.
The driver on the bus says, Move on back, move on back, move on back.  The driver on the bus says, Move on back. All through the town.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep. The horn on the goes beep, beep, beep all through the town.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish. Swish, swish, swish. Swish, swish, swish. The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish, all through the town.  
The seatbelts on the bus go click, click, click. Click, click, click. Click, click, click. The seatbelts on the bus go click, click, click, all through the town.
The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus go round and round all through the town.
The baby on the bus goes, Wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah, wah.  The baby on the bus goes, Wah, wah, wah, all through the town.
The mommy on the bus goes, Shhh don't cry. Shhh don't cry. Shhh don't cry.  The mommy on the bus goes, Shhh don't cry, all through the town. 
The cow on the bus goes, Moo, moo, moo. A cow! You can't fit a cow on the bus. It's too big! No! The people on the bus go up and down, up and down, up and down. The people on the bus go up and down, all through the town.

Square Dance Cadence
by The Learning Station
From the CD, Kid's Country Song & Dance
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station (All rights reserved.)

Lyrics
(Follow the directions, repeat each line, and answer YEA! in the choruses)
Stand up straight make a country line.
We’re all spruced up and looking fine.
Ya’ll do what I do and say what I say,
Country square dance, HIP HURRAY!
March in place and groove to the beat.
Clap and stomp your country feet.
Swing your lasso overhead.
Bring it down, now put it to bed.

Chorus: Can you feel it?-YEA! Can you do it?-YEA!
You want more? YEA! Square Dance till the cows come home.
Turn and face your partner friend.
Shake their hand and bow your head.
Now do-se-do and holler “Yay!”
Get on your horse and gallop away.
Stand in place and clap along.
Twiddle your thumbs to this song.
Girls all curtsy, boys please bow.
Tip your hat, wag your tail like a cow. Repeat Chorus
Bend your knees up and down.
Wiggle your shoulders all around.
Fiddle your banjo strings real fast.
Stomp one boot to the YEEHA BLAST!
Stand up straight, arms by your side.
Rock back and forth, like a PONY RIDE!
Swing your lasso shout YAHOO!
Climb off your horse and dust your shoe.
Hands on your waist, flap em’ around
Wag your tail feathers, to this sound.
Tell your partner HOWDY HO!
Spin around and do-se-do. Repeat Chorus
Bounce in place to the country beat.
Jump up high, then sit on your seat.
Turn to your partner one last time.
Shake their hand, here comes a rhyme.
Say twiddle dee, twiddle doo.
It’s been real fun square dancin’ with you!
Tip your hat for a proper goodbye.
A big country smile and the wink of an eye.

Lyrics:
Sit back and rest. You can sit on the ground with your legs out straight and your back leaning against something. Or  you can sit in your chair, with your legs long, your feet flat on the floor while you lean against the back of your chair.  

Get comfortable. 

We’re going turn on the energy in our bodies. And then we’re going to be turning it off.  

Let’s begin with your toes. Wiggle your toes to wake them up. 

Ready? Tighten your toes, like you’re making a fist with them. Try to only turn on the power in  your toes, and let all other areas of your body rest. Breathe in while they are tight.

And then when you breathe out, turn the energy off. Let your toes rest. 

Again. Breathe in and turn the energy on in your toes...just your toes. Breathe out to turn it off and let the tightness go. 

Let’s give your legs a chance.  Turn on the energy in your legs, straighten them if that helps. 

Make tight, tense muscles. Now breathe in to add even more energy.  

Exhale and let go. Legs go soft. Power goes off. 

Let’s do one more round with legs. Ready? 

Start breathing in, turn the energy on, legs are working hard, tight, tense. 
Then turn that energy off, breathe out, relax , soften those muscles. 

You’re in control. 

Now your hands. Make fists and inhale as you turn your energy on, and then let’s exhale and rest. Turn it all off. 

Add your arms this time. They can be straight or bent. 
Make fists, arms get tight, energy ON, breathe in. 
Breathe out and let go. Energy OFF. 

Arms and hands one more time. Turn it on with an in breath, and turn it off with an outbreath. 

And finally, we’re going to try the  whole body. If you want, add your face muscles too - crinkle up your eyes, your lips, your cheeks.  

Ready? Breathe in and turn on your whole body’s energy...toes, feet, legs, hands, arms, face. Feel the energy in your body. It’s ON! 

And now turn it all off while you breathe out slowly. Relax. The energy’s off. 

See if you can stay still, just for a little.

Energy’s off. 

Notice how you might feel different in your body, now that you’ve practiced being in 
control of your very own on and off switch.",Kids brain break,false

Twist your shoes, to the color blue
Wiggle like jello, to the color yellow

Touch your back, to the color black
Jump up and down, to the color brown
Stretch to the right, to the color white
Turn in a circle, to the color purple
Rock Your Body to the Colors you see


Hands up and sway, to the color grey
Use your brain and think, to the color pink
Make the shape of an orange, to the color orange
Fly like a manta, to the color magenta

The Hop and Stop Song
 
Come on everybody do the hop and stop.
You jump like a rabbit when I say hop
And then you freeze when I say stop
That is the hop and stop. 
 
You hop on your right leg, don’t you quit. 
While you touch your nose with your fingertip.
Hop on your right leg, hop, hop, hop. 
Now I’m going to tell you to stop. 
 
You hop on your left leg, it’s what I said
While you use your hand to tap your head.
Hop on your left leg, hop, hop, hop.
Now I’m going to tell you to stop. 
Now hop…stop…hop…stop!
   
You hop on both legs and turn around
Flap like chicken making chicken sounds.
You hop on both legs, hop, hop, hop.
Now I’m going to tell you to stop. 
Now hop…stop…hop…stop, hop, stop!
 
Hooray, everybody you hopped and stopped.
You jumped up and down when said hop
And then you froze when I say stop
That is the hop and stop.
 
Now you know the hop and stop! 
 
Now STOP!

These movements are scientifically shown to create new brain cells (do cardio for 20 minutes or more) and these brain cells are directly linked to memory and academic performance.  When you cross the midline of your body by touching right hand to left knee you are activating both sides of the brain, developing literacy pre-reading skills, and getting your brain to optimize at it’s best capacity! Push-ups help strengthen hands and arms which help with writing and fine motor plus it’s working core strength too.

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move
Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try
Do your best, pump your muscles up
Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Move like windshield wipers working in the rain
Sway your arms back and forth wipe the rain away

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a racehorse running on the track
Gallop like a horse moving smooth and fast

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a dancer grooving to the beat
Rollin',  rockin', Hip-hoppin' 
From your head down to your feet

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a sports star get ready for the race
Stretching, flexing, shooting for first place
Let's move, let's move

Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try
Do your best, pump your muscles up
Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Your body is amazing it can do so many things
Run, jump, twist, turn, dance, learn and sing
So keep your body healthy, treat it like a friend
Take care of it and eat good foods
And keep it movin'

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try

Education is the key to success. The main purpose of this channel is to provide a stimulating online learning environment for kids of all ages. 
A learning environment that encourages community,  acts as a guide for parents and promotes the individual skills as well as confidence in each child.

Throughout my teaching experience, I have found that children earn best when actively engaged and provided with multiple forms of instruction. When children make connections to past experiences they will not only retain information longer, but they will also master material and become more confident in their own abilities.

I am excited to provide an enriched educational experience to children from all over the world.",Kids brain break,false

When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the mid-line. 

Crossover tells children exactly what part of the body they're to crossover from right to left and left to right so it's very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.

Crossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right. When we engage children in crossover movements blood flow is increased in all parts of the brain making it more alert and energized for optimal learning.

Use this song as a great musical brain breaks activity for stimulating the brain and body.

Lyrics: 

Can you whip you your tail like a dinosaur

Whip, whip 
Can you whip you your tail like a dinosaur 

Whip, whip 
Come on everybody get on the floor
And let me hear that ferocious roar
Can you whip your tail like a dinosaur 

Can you reach up to the sky 
Grab a leaf in the tree so high 
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Reach, reach, reach, reach 

Can you stomp, stomp, stomp 
on the ground, on the group so loud 
on the ground so loud 
Stomp, stomp, stomp
On the ground so loud 
Can you stomp so loud, can you stomp on the ground 

These dance songs are wonderful for babies, toddlers, children in preschool and even older kids and adults! Preschoolers love moving to music and learning through music! Kids love to dance-a-long with groups of friends and their teachers!

Video mashup for Kids: #1 Learning our Seasons by The Learning Station
LYRICS
IT’S SHOWTIME!
Today’s mash up show is titled,  Learning our Seasons, so….let’s get started! COME ON CLAP YOUR HANDS…

It’s a beautiful day here at the home of The Learning Station. And from all of us we’d like to say
GOOD MORNING…

Temperatures are very chilly somewhere in the world right now. And it can get very cold especially when
IN THE WINTER…

Of course, winter is just one of the 4 seasons, which all have different weather and temperatures, but the season after winter makes it easy to put your coats away. After all, IN THE SPRING…

Warm weather is so pleasant. Rain showers and pretty flowers! But what follows Spring is lots of sun and high temperatures, because…IN THE SUMMER  

After all the sun and scorching weather of the summer, it’s time to put away your swimsuits and break out your sweaters and jackets for the next season. It’s Autumn but some people like to say IN THE FALL…

It doesn’t matter what season it is, every single amazing day gives you a new beginning, and another reason to be helpful, thankful and just plain wonderful!

If you’re like me, it’s fun seeing people you care about. They are all like shining stars, and you know what? They make you feel like a shining star too! 

What we learned today, is that any season is the season of caring for and caring about people you love. Those people ARE shining stars and YOU are shining stars to them! Can you can just feel it? 

Thanks for watching and joining in!  This program was brought to you by Old McDonald’s Farm where it’s okay to have a cow. And by 5 Little Ducks where mother duck just quacks you up! I look forward to seeing you next time! As always…IT’S SHOWTIME

Why are those kids jumping up and down? 
Why are those kids jumping up and down? Why are those kids jumping up and down? 

Maybe the ground is hot...
Maybe they ate jumping beans...
Maybe they’re afraid of mice...
Maybe it’s Saturday...
Maybe their uncle gave them a dollar...
Maybe they want to get the ants out of their pants because they’ve been sitting in school all day and they just need to get up and move around so they don’t go nuts!

Yeah, that’s probably it.

Children will love acting out the movements and saying the words with the Gingerbread Man. Learning to retell familiar stories can build the confidence of young readers and increase comprehension skills. Sing and act out the story of The Gingerbread Man to build brain and body connections.

LYRICS:

The Gingerbread Man

Once upon a time there was a Gingerbread 
Man and his story goes like this;
One day a little old man and a little old lady made a Gingerbread Man together.
Soon they opened the oven door
Pop!  Out ran the Gingerbread Man
And the little old lady said, “Gingerbread Man, stop, you look so good, we want to eat you up!”
Chorus:  Run, run as fast as you can
 You can’t catch me
 I’m the Gingerbread Man 
(Repeat Chorus)
Soon the Gingerbread Man was skipping through the woods,
Skip, skip, skip to my Lou
Skip, skip, skip to my Lou
And he met a cow
And the cow went, “Gingerbread Man, stop, you look so good,
 I want to eat you up!”
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
Farther down the country road, the Gingerbread Man was hopping along
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop
Hop, hop, hop
And he met a horse
And the horse went, “Gingerbread Man, stop, you look so good, I want to eat you up!”
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
At last the Gingerbread Man met a fox,
A sly, old fox, grinning and licking his lips
And the fox said; “Hey little gingerbread dude, stop, I want to talk you.”
The Gingerbread Man kept running and the fox chased after him
 “Oh no, a river”
The Gingerbread Man didn’t know what to do
“Hey, little dude, I’ll help you, just jump on my tail.  I’ll take you across the river, no problemo.”
Swim, swim, swim,
 I love to swim
“But dude, for the most awesome ride jump on my nose.  That’s it, Gingerbread Man.  That’s just right!”
That sly, old fox got to the other side of the river and tossed the little Gingerbread Man in the air
Snip, snap!
(Repeat Chorus 2x)

Way Down Yonder (Frog Song)
From the CD, Tony Chestnut & Fun Time Action Songs
by The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station (All rights reserved.)
 
LYRICS:
Way down yonder in the yankity yank, the bull frog jumped from bank to bank
because he had nothing better for him to do.
He stubbed his toe and he fell in the water. You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter
because he had nothing better for him to do.
And then a bee saw it happen, he was on a safari. 
This is what it sounds like when he tells his story.

Bzz Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz, Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz
Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz
Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz, Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz
Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz

And then a hen saw it happen, she was on a safari. 
This is what it sounds like when she tells her story.

Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck, Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck
Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck, buck gawk, buck buck, buck gawk
Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck, Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck
Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck, buck gawk, buck, buck gawk

And then a duck saw it happen, he was on a safari. 
This is what it sounds like when he tells his story.

Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack, Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack
Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack
Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack, Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack
Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack, Quack

And then a man saw it happen he was driving his Ferrari.
They all got together and they told this story.

(All sing and make their sounds)
Way down yonder in the yankity yank, the bull frog jumped from bank to bank
because he had nothing better for him to do.
He stubbed his toe and he fell in the water. You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter
because he had nothing better for him to do, because he had nothing better for him to do.

Where the wild things are
One of my favorite books by far 
I love when Max becomes king 
But my favorite part to sing
Is:
They roared there terrible roar
And they gnashed their terrible teeth 
They rolled their terrible eyes
And they showed their terrible claws (REPEAT)
      
Where the wild things are
One of my favorite books my far
I love when they do the wild romp In the jungle and the swamp.
But I love when
They roared there terrible roars
And they gnashed their terrible teeth They rolled their terrible eyes
And they showed their terrible claws (REPEAT)     
(Spoken)
And now....let the WILD ROMPUS START!
      
Everybody get up
And let me see you jump jump! 
Every body get up
and let me see you Jump jump jump
      
Everybody get up
And let me see your jump jump! Everybody get up
and let me see you jump
      
They roared their terrible roars
And they gnashed their terrible teeth 
They rolled their terrible eyes
And they showed their terrible claws (REPEAT)

Children will learn the moves to this fun doo wop dance song! This action, dance is great for brain breaks, indoor recess and group activities!

Doo Wop Dancing Voices is a great action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into actions and movements that allow them to:
• refresh
• recharge
• refocus
• regenerate
• release stress
• breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increases circulation and promotes physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also ideal for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Doo Wop Dancing Voices
From the CD, You Can Dance!
by The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
Doo Wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music popular in the mid-1950's and early 60's. This style contains harmonizing vocals using nonsense syllables. Have a seat, feel the beat and follow the directions to this cool, vocal dancing song that concludes with a fun hand-jive.

Repeated refrain throughout:
Doo wop doo wop a rub a dub a doo wop a wop a ram a lam doo wop a wop scoobby doo doo
Ding a ling a ling a ling a linga loo Babba ran a bada bing.
Verse:
We're gonna bounce to the Doo Wop Dancing beat.
We're gonna sing and harmonize our voices right from our seat.
We're gonna clap to the rhythm and move to the sound,
To the doo wop dancing voices all around.
Sing whoop whoop - whoop whoop
Sing a woe we wo wo - a woe we wo wo
Sing dum ditty dum - dum ditty dum
Sing shoop shoop - shoop shoop

Shimmy your shoulders to the Doo Wop beat.
This is a dance we're gonna do right from our seat.
You gotta feel the rhythm and tap with your feet.
Doo Wop Dancing Voices harmonizing is neat.
Sing...
sha sha - sha sha
Sing na na na na - na na na na
Sing aah aah - aah aah
Sing la la la la - la la la la Repeat Verse
Sing oh oh oh - oh oh oh
Sing go go go - go go go
Sing ooh ooh ooh - ooh ooh ooh
Sing ga ga goo - ga ga goo

Elvis: Hello, everybody, it's Elvis.
I want you all to follow me with some Doo Wop moves right from your seat...
(Now), Roll your hands to the left, (now) roll (your hands) (them) to the right...
Everybody tap your knees, (oh, baby) (you're out of sight)
(Now), Tap your fists together.
(Now) Cross your hands above. (Now) Switch and cross them below.
(Now) Tap your right elbow, (and then) (Now tap) your left (elbow) then
All we can do is start all over again...
(Repeat this section 2X)
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.

From the DVD: All Aboard Vids for Kids
From the CD, Play to Rest
By The Learning Station

I got the wiggles and they just won't quit.
I'd like to lay down or maybe just sit.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,
some rest some rest I know and stop the wiggles for good.

I got the wiggles for about a week
My legs are shaky I can hardly speak.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,
some rest some rest I know
and stop the wiggles for good.

I got the wiggles and they just won't quit.
I'd like to lay down or maybe just sit.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,
some rest some rest I know and stop the wiggles for good.

I got the wiggles for about a week
My legs are shaky I can hardly speak.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,

Tony Chestnut knows I love you.   (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) 
Tony knows.  Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) 
Tony Chestnut knows I love you. (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) 
That's what Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.)

And Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)
But Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)
And there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) 
This song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)
How it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)
And guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.)

This cool kid-friendly song starts out with a message about staying healthy and fit and having fun counting to 100 together.
It's a great count to 100 song for Kindergarten.
I show the children simple, easy - to - do exercises for each 10 numbers. Children have a variety of gross motor movements to do as they count to 100. 
    The songs great beat and steady counting motivate children to keep moving all the way to 100. We show the numbers  from 1 to 100 very large and clear so children also get the visual number recognition and stimulation. 
    This count to 100 song will engage your children with the catchy up tempo music, the clear numeral visuals and seeing Jack sing and demonstrate the exercises.
     Use Count to 100 - Let's Get Fit every day to strengthen your children's ability to count to 100 and help them enjoy and have fun exercising  too.
     Counting to 100 and basic number recognition is a standard in most early childhood ( pre-k, K and 1st grade)  classrooms.

This is a great math song to start your day with, as a brain break or use it during indoor recess. 

PE Teachers will love it too as it emphasizes physical education and aerobic exercise as children count to 100.

Bye, bye, bye butterfly
Gotta scat kitty cat

Got to truck baby duck
Take good care brown bear
Thumbs up little pup
In the morn unicorn
See ya soon raccoon

BEAN BAG EXERCISING
Lyrics:
There is nothing like a good friend to share an exercise with. So pick up your bean bag, stand up and let’s start exercising with the bean bag stretch. Put the bean bag in your right hand and stretch your arm up as high as you can. And bring it back down. That’s it! Stretch up and down. Stretch up and down. Stretch up and down. Stretch up and down. Now put the bean bag in your left hand and let’s try it again. Stretch up and down. Stretch up and
down. Stretch up and down. Good job! Now let’s try the bean bag lift. Everyone sit down. Keep your legs out straight and feet close together. Put your bean bag on top of your feet. Lift your feet and the bean bag up, not too high, then bring them back down. Are you ready? Here we go! Feet up and down. Feet up and down. Feet up and down. Now everyone jump up and hold your bean bag in your hand because it’s time to bean bag jog. Jog in
place, not too fast and keep those knees up! Jogging in place is so healthy and fun. Bean bag exercising!
You’re doing great! Let’s try the bean bag squeeze. Exercising our hand and our fingers. Put the bean bag in your right hand and, using all your fingers, squeeze it as hard as you can. Now, loosen up those fingers. That’s it! Squeeze — loosen up, squeeze — loosen up, squeeze — loosen up. Now put the bean bag in your left hand and let’s try that again. Altogether now. Squeeze — loosen up, squeeze — loosen up, squeeze — loosen up.
That was great. I think you are ready to try the bean bag toe touch. Make sure you’re standing up straight and tall and hold the bean bag with both hands. Bend down and touch the bean bag to your toes and try not to bend those knees, and then stand back up. Altogether now, here we go! Bend, touch your toes — stand up. Bend, touch your toes — stand up. All right, it’s time to bean bag jog, so hold your bean bag in your hand and jog in place. Not too fast, and keep those knees up! Jogging in place is so healthy and fun. Bean bag exercising! I’m feeling really great! We really had a healthy bean bag workout. Now it’s time to take that well deserved — REST.

Get your students moving with these easy to follow exercises!!

During this video, students are expected to roll dice and follow the movement instructions that are shown on the screen. They should try to do each movement for 30 seconds before rolling the dice again. The music in the video will motivate and inspire your students.  
Health and physical education offers students a unique opportunity for kinesthetic learning – they learn about healthy, active living primarily by “doing”, that is, through physical activity. In health and physical education, students discover the joy of movement, learn about their bodies, and develop physical and cognitive skills that will contribute to their lifelong health and well-being.

Children see the movements and follow along.  Kids hear and see the clapping pattern, clap along to the pattern and move their body. 

Clapping Machine really helps your children listen carefully for the auditory queues and visual clapping pattern and see the dance movements. They have a chance to follow me exactly, as I show them the clapping pattern and the movement. The repetition in this brain breaks song is wonderful for young children as it helps them to anticipate the auditory pattern and movement. Recognizing patterns like the ones in my song, and in the world around us builds critical math and reading skills. 

Taking brain breaks is very helpful for children to do their best schoolwork.  Music, movement and fun allows them to refresh and recharge their brain and body. Use Clapping Machine anytime in the classroom or at home for a fun and developmentally appropriate  brain break activity for young children. Kids love the cool beat and sounds of this song, and it really helps children develop their listening skills and awareness of patterns.

Who had a broken broom
When he went anywhere, it would wobble in the air
And his heart would fill with gloom
He tried so hard to fix it every night
But he just couldn't get it working right
The Wobblin' goblin with the broken broom
Could never fly too high
For right after take-off
Another piece would break off
And soon he would be danglin' in the sky!
Each evening just as he would leave the ground
His radio would say
""Control tower to goblin
Your broom stick is wobblin'
You better make a landing right away""
It soon got so he could only ride
When the witches took him piggy back
Until at last, he used his brain
And bought himself an aero-plane!
So if you look for him on Halloween
You'll see him zip and zoom
No harm can befall him, no longer can they call him
The Wobblin' goblin with the broken broom!

Dakota is a talented but aimless singer, besieged by a failed relationship and struggling to make peace with her past. Dakota's life wasn't always at a stalemate. Dakota had once been offered a full-ride scholarship to a New York City graduate program for vocal performance, and her musical collaborations with her best friend Robert were gaining traction online. When Dakota meets Logan after a performance, she falls for him hard and fast, choosing him over the potential of her music career. Although Logan supports Dakota's music, he's suspicious of Dakota and Robert's friendship. Logan's jealousies eventually get the better of him and he breaks up with Dakota, even after she's put her life on hold to be with him. Two years later, Dakota now works a dead-end job, lives at home with her mom, and struggles to cut ties with Logan, even years after their breakup. Estranged from Robert, and constantly arguing with her mother, Dakota is desperate to prove that she isn't a failure. Feeling like she's losing control of her life, Dakota decides to give music another chance, and sets out on a new path – albeit, not a straight one.",Kids brain break,true

waiting for that special someone to arrive.
Santa Clause and the Holy Child,
star crossed lovers time divides,
everybody waits 
on Christmas eve.


Chorus
Little children dance 
around the Christmas tree,
I'm asking for a second chance
for you and me.
So make a wish 
or say a prayer,
there's magic in the air,
if you believe, 
on Christmas eve.


Verse 2
It's Christmas eve 
and this year I'm waiting,
waiting for my special someone to arrive.
Underneath the mistletoe,
this time I'm not letting go,
everybody waits 
on Christmas eve.

I’m in the jungle roaring 
but when it gets too boring 
I go a carnivoring 
hey hey hey hey

eating meat is my game 
extinction I became

swoop - there goes a pterodactyl 
nothing rhymes pterodactyl 
I just like pterodactyls

(Activity: Have the children pretend they are swimming, using the backstroke etc. as prompted by the song.) 
Lyrics:
VERSE 1
I went for a walk and the walk was cool. I saw some people in the swimming pool. They swam to the right, swam to the left. These are the things that they did best. They backstroked, they backstroked,
they backstroked until they...
VERSE 2
went for a walk and the walk was cool, saw some people in the swimming pool. They swam to the right, swam to the left. But these are the things that they did best. They doggie paddled,
they doggie paddled, they doggie paddled until they....
REPEAT VERSE 2 - replacing doggie paddled with breast stroked, snorkeled, dove and towel dried
FINAL VERSE
went for a walk and the walk was cool, nobody left in the swimming pool. They walked to the right, they walked to the left. But these are the things that they did best. They walked, they walked,
they walked until they... went home of course.

Wild Things is a fun dance, action and freeze song for children. It is a popular kids learning song that is part of literacy awareness programs, brain breaks, morning meeting and indoor recess. This kids dance song is ideal for preschool, kindergarten and elementary children.

Wild Things lyrics and movements:
(Children perform all of the fun actions in the song and freeze when we sing, “Be still”.)
I’m wild when I gnash my teeth. I’m wild when I show my claws.
Be still (freeze). Now, gnash your teeth.
Be still (freeze). Now, show your claws.
I’m wild. I’m wild. I’m so wild!

I’m king of the wild things, that’s my part.
Listen to me. Let the rumpus start!

I’m wild when I roar my roar. I’m wild when I roll my eyes.
Be still (freeze). Now, roar your roar.
Be still (freeze). Now, roar your eyes.
I’m wild. I’m wild. I’m so wild!

I’m king of the wild things, loved by all.
Listen to me. We’ll have a ball!

I’m wild when I gnash my teeth and I show my claws.
I’m wild when I roar my roar and I roll my eyes.
Be still (freeze). Now, gnash your teeth and show your claws.
Be still (freeze). Now, roar your roar and roll your eyes.
I’m wild. I’m wild. I’m so wild! Yes, I’m wild!

Lyrics:
Robot: “Tummy in, shoulders back”
Robots stand still. We’ll stand up straight not moving.       
We’ll move then stop. It’s hard to bend that steel.    
We’re stiff and straight with every little motion.  
We’re just machines but we certainly look real. 

Raise your right hand up a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    
Now lower that hand down a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    

Raise your left hand up a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    
Now lower that hand down a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    
I’m a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. 
I’m a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. 

Now turn your head to the right a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop   
Now turn your head back just a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    

Now turn your head to the left a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop   
Now turn your head back just a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more…stop    
I’m a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. 
I’m a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms.  

Robot: “Stop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.” 1,2,3,4 

Robots stand still. We’ll stand up straight not moving.       
We’ll move then stop. It’s hard to bend that steel.    
We’re stiff and straight with every little motion.  
We’re just machines but we certainly look real. 

Raise your right leg up a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more …stop    
Now lower that leg down a little bit …stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more …stop    
Raise your left leg up a little bit…stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more …stop
Now lower that leg down a little bit …stop, 
A little more…stop, A little more …stop    
I’m a robot, dancing robot, moving all around. 
I’m a robot, dancing robot, moving all around.
I’m a robot, dancing robot, moving all around.
I’m a robot, dancing robot, moving all around.
I’m a robot, dancing robot, 
Robot: “Breakdown…Robot tired. Must take rest! See you later!”

""Stir it Up"" lyrics, actions and movements:
“You might think Physical Ed doesn’t dance. Well, he dances. I’m his brother Jim Nasium and I made up some special dances just for you and he because I know how he likes to shake his bad self. Follow me.” 
Put one hand on the top and one hand on the bottom. 
Grab your stirring stick now stir’em if you got’em. 
Gonna stir it up. Stir it up quick. Gonna stir it up fast, gonna stir it up slow, here we go. 
Stir it up slow. Stir it up slow. Stir it up fast. Stir it up fast. We’re gonna stir it up slow. We’re gonna stir it up quick with our stirring stick. 

Put one hand on the top and one hand on the bottom. 
Grab your pogo stick now pogo if you got’em. Gonna pogo up. Pogo up quick. 
We’re gonna pogo up fast, gonna pogo up slow, here we go. 
Pogo up slow. Pogo up slow. Pogo up fast. Pogo up fast. We’re gonna pogo up slow. We’re gonna pogo up quick with our pogo sticks. 

Put one hand on the top and one hand on the bottom. 
Grab your broom stick now sweep’em if you got’em. Gonna sweep it up. Sweep it up quick. We’re gonna sweep it up fast, gonna sweep it up slow, here we go. 
Sweep it up slow. Sweep it up slow. Sweep it up fast. Sweep it up fast. We’re gonna sweep it up slow. We’re gonna sweep it up quick with our broom sticks. 

Put one hand on the top and one hand on the bottom. Grab your stirring stick now stir’em if you got’em. Gonna stir it up. Stir it up quick. Gonna stir it up fast, gonna stir it up slow, here we go. Stir it up slow. Stir it up slow. Stir it up fast. Stir it up fast. We’re gonna stir it up slow. We’re gonna stir it up quick with our stirring stick. 

“C’mon now everybody.” Stir it up. Now pogo up. Now sweep it up. And now stir it up. We’re gonna do anything that we want to do. Just do it! (crowd sounds)

LYRICS:
[Chorus]: Brain breaks, got to take them now and then.
Brain breaks, we take them on a whim.
Brain breaks, give our mind a rest.
Brain breaks, so we can be our best.
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate.
Cross it left, and cross it right.
Because it works both day and night.
Crisscross, it makes my brain a better boss. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. With my arms I make a figure 8.
This helps my brain communicate. Figure 8's, learning's great with figure 8's. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. Feet apart, hands on your knees.
Cross your shoulders, helps fatigue. Spinal twist, it goes like this, spinal twist. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. Rub your ears, unfold the flaps.
Listening, becomes a snap. Rub your ears. It helps us hear the music. Rub your ears. (2x)
Time now to get back on task. Wave to a friend, this feeling can last.
Find your seat, or sit where you are. Slowly, calmly, be a star.

Our animated Hip- Hop Tooty Ta song  is super popular children’s song and dance. Students get some fun physical activity,while they rejuvenate their body and brain. Children everywhere love Tooty ta! Tooty Ta is a growing pattern, repeat after me song and dance.

Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student’s attention, giving them a mental and physical break from their academics. This  enables them to have a better focus for learning. 
 Tooty-Ta as a “brain break” is a win-win situation. Students learn during these “brain breaks” plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My  Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.
It’s also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

This interval workout assistant shows new workouts every 30 seconds for up to 8 stations. This allows the teacher to group students in a number of ways and workout to a variety of exercise stations.


TABATA is a form of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) used by fitness programs ranging from elementary PE to professional athletes. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the program is as follows:

Work out hard for 20 seconds...
Rest for 10 seconds...
REPEAT.
Complete 8 rounds.

You push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise. 

This is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.

Lyrics:

Intro:
Lots of little fish were sleeping on a rock in the bottom of the ocean.
They lifted up their heads and they shook ot their tails and they said let’s go swimming.

Chorus
Let’s go swimming. Let’s go swimming
Yeah let’s go swimming. Let’s go swimming
Let’s go swimming in the bottom of the ocean.

Bridge:
Then the little fish got so very very tired.
But they came back to the rock.
They put down their heads and they put down their tails
and they took a little nap.

And when they woke up. They were a little bit dirty. So they took a shower.
And they washed their hair and they washed their ears. And they washed
their tummies and they washed their very long fishy beards.
And they washed their noses. And they washed their toeses.
And then they said wait a minute we’re fish. We don’t take showers

Chorus and Bridge

And When they woke up. They decided to ride their bicycles.
So they rode to the left and they rode to the right.
And road all daaaaay and they rode all night night night night night.
And they rode down the hill and then faster still
and then they said. Wait a minute we’re fish we don’t ride bicycles.

Chorus and Bridge

And when they woke up. They decided to brush their teeth.
So they got out their toothbrush. And their toothpaste.
And they squeezed a little on.
They really liked the taste. Then they put it in their mouth.
They brushed north and south.
Chuka chee chukka chee Chuka chee chukka chee. 
And then they said
wait a minute, we’re fish, we don’t brush our teeth.

Chorus 2X

Safe and Calm
From the CD, Brain Boogie Boosters
By The Learning Station and Dr. Becky Bailey                                                                                                                                                
℗© Monopoli, Bailey/The Learning Station
LYRICS:
Dr. Becky Bailey's Brain Booster: Being at peace, breathing, and feeling calm and relaxed requires the CEO of the brain (the frontal lobes) to quiet the rest of the brain. Strengthening the frontal lobes improves our ability to pay attention and be engaged.

Lie down or sit in a comfortable position. 
Slowly close your eyes.
Let your arms gently relax by your side or in your lap.
Notice your breath flowing in and out. 
Each breath says, I am safe and I am calm. 
I am safe and I am calm. 
Slowly, place your hands on your belly. 
Breathe in, have your belly go out. 
Breath out, have your belly go in. 
Breathe in, have your belly go out. 
Breath out, have your belly go in. 
Breathe in, have your belly go out. I'm safe. 
Breath out, have your belly go in.
I'm calm and full of love. 
Relax your feet. Feel them melt. 
Relax your legs. Feel them melt. 
Thank your legs for their gifts.
Relax your arms. Feel them melt. 
Relax your hands. Feel them melt. 
Thank your hands for their gifts. 
Breathe in, have your belly go out. I'm safe. 
Breath out, have your belly go in. I'm calm and full of love.
Relax your face. Feel it melt. Relax your eyes. Feel them melt. 
Thank your eyes for their gifts. Gently and slowly open your eyes. 
Feel the peace down in your soul. You are a gift to the world. 
Offer that gift to others.

★ Lyrics
We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A ghostly, ghoulish goblin waving cheerfully. 
He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A very vain vampire waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.
SOUND EFFECT- Door closing to a slam!

Good morning (good morning) to you. It’s so nice to see you. 
It’s fun greeting you. Here we are (good morning) and we’ll shine like a star.
We could just wave... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
Or we could shake hands... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? Let’s celebrate. It’s a brand new day.)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? It’s a beautiful day.)

Good morning (good morning) to you. It’s so nice to see you. 
It’s fun greeting you. Here we are (good morning) and we’ll shine like a star.
We could just wave... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
Or we could shake hands... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? Let’s celebrate. It’s a brand new day.)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? It’s a beautiful day.)

Good morning (good morning) to you. It’s so nice to see you. 
It’s fun greeting you. Here we are (good morning) and we’ll shine like a star.
We could just wave... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
Or we could shake hands... (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? Let’s celebrate. It’s a brand new day.)
(Hey, hey, what do you say? It’s a beautiful day.)

Good morning.

'WE'RE GOING ON A LION HUNT SONG LYRICS FOR KIDS'
We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Oh, Look at that tall wavy grass
It's so tall

Can't go over it  X2
Can't go under it X2
Just going to have to go through it  X2
swish swish swish 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, there's a big river
Can't go over it X2 
Can't go under it X2 
Going to have to swim it X2
splash splash splash 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Ugh, look at all that mud
so muddy
Can't go over it  X2
Can't go under it X2
Going to have to go through it
squish squish squish  

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared X2

Uh oh, what's that
It's a cave
We can't go over it
We can't go under it
Going to have to go into it
step step step 

We're going on a lion hunt X2
I've got my binoculars X2
I'm not scared 
I'm a little scared

Sure is dark in here
What's that in the corner
I feel 2  big ears  X 2
I feel 1 wet nose  X 2
I feel 2 sharp teeth  X2 
I know what that is
It's a lion

Let's get out of here

Let's run out of the cave
step step step 

Quickly back through the mud
squish squish squish

Let's cross the river
splash splash splash 

Through the tall grass
swish swish swish


Through the yard, up the stairs, into the house, close the door

We're safe

That's a close one

Let's not go lion hunting anymore!

Physical activity can prevent depression and learned helplessness by acting on the serotonin circuits. 
Get up and move! Emotional states are called “action sets” because they prepare us to act in certain ways. When we feel good on the inside, we learn better and act better on the outside. Let’s Boogie! 
(Everyone sing the first verse in unison. During the Chorus touch your head, your feet, then shake, shout and rock to the beat. Follow the directions in each verse and keep doing that same 
movement throughout the Refrains.) 
LYRICS:
Blues, blues go away. We want to sing and dance today.
Blues, blues go away. Brain Boogie Boosters are here to stay.
[Chorus] Get the brain boogie rockin’ beat 
From your head, down to your feet. 
Everybody wiggle, shake and shout. Yeah!
That’s what this boogie song is all about.
Hold your arms up way high.
Cross your hands up in the sky.
Cross your ankles, bend your knees,
Wiggle down to the beat.
[Refrain] Wiggle down-Wiggle up-Wiggle down-Wiggle up
Shake it left-Shake it right-Shake it left-Shake it right
We clap to the beat. We step with our feet.
Brain boogie rockin’ is really neat.
[Repeat Chorus]
Left hand to right toe, right hand to left toe
Twice as fast, now touch and go
Left and right, to and fro 
[Repeat Refrain]
[Repeat Chorus]
Hold your arms down by your sides. 
Jump up and down but not too high. Cross your arms behind your back. Now, jump just like a jumping jack. [Repeat Refrain]

I got a hat, it’s a baseball hat. Put it on my head and give it a tap, then I spin around and clap. Then I spin around my hat. I got a hat, it’s a big straw hat. Put it on my head and give it a tap, then I spin around and clap. Then I spin around my hat. Chorus: Without a hat you’d have a cold head, unprotected from the weather. I wear a hat, a cloth one and sometimes even leather. Without a hat, you’d have a head unprotected from the sun. I wear a hat because of three words... it’s real fun!

About the Game 
7 Days to Die is an early access survival horror video game set in an open world developed by The Fun Pimps. The game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear Third World War that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, Arizona. 

The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane.

I consulted with physical education teachers in developing this new count to 100 song.

This count to 100 song includes some creative and fun new exercises and some physical education positions that are required in PE. I have included cross lateral movements that are so important for body and brain connections and improved brain coordination. Studies have linked increased academic performance to cross lateral movements.    

We are so pleased this count to 100 song has become so popular all over the world. Children seem to love the energy of the music that is great for motivating children to move. I try to do my part and do the song with energy and enthusiasm too.

Exercise is so important for our children. I believe in it, and try to swim, run or bike everyday. I say the numbers very clearly so children can understand and say them with me as we count to 100.

About the Game 
7 Days to Die is an early access survival horror video game set in an open world developed by The Fun Pimps. The game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear Third World War that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, Arizona. 

The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane.

My video, Exercise and Count by 5's is a classroom hit across the world. It's cool Latin beat makes it easy to exercise and count by 5.

Kids count by 5 as they exercise by stretching their arms and legs and across the mid-line of their bodies. This help kids with engaging both their bodies and their minds.

Making exercise and learning fun for kids is important for their physical and emotional growth. Exercise and Count by 5's does this beautifully as well as develop children's gross motor movements. This is a fun way to teach kids to count by 5.

Follow along with me and count by 5 out loud and exercise!

Lyrics:
Five fingers on my right hand stretch to the left
Five fingers on my left hand stretch to the right
Now, stretch each hand up side to side
Use your body and your brain and exercise
And count by fives
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
Five toes on my right foot step to the left
Five toes on my left foot step to the right
Now, lift each leg up, step up high
Use your body and your brain and exercise
And count by fives
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 100
Five fingers on my right hand stretch to left
Five fingers on my left hand stretch to the right
Now, stretch each hand up side to side
Use your body and your brain and exercise
And count by fives

Children everywhere love Tooty- ta!
Tooty- Ta can really help to re-focus student’s attention, get a mental and physical break from their academics  enabling them to have a better focus for learning.  Using my cool Pop version of
Tooty-Ta as a “brain break” is a win-win situation. Students learn during these “brain breaks” plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty -Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.  This version of Tooty - Ta will get your kids moving and dancing!

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My Pop version of Tooty - Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty -Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.

Check out some of our Hip-Hop dance moves which are ideal for crossing the mid-line.  It’s also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty -Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

Ain’t it Great to be Crazy 
LYRICS
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy?  Tap each leg. Thumbs side of face, wiggling fingers.
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us? Tap each leg. Jack-in-the box jumping up.
Silly and foolish all day long,  Jack-in-the box spinning around
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? Tap each leg. Thumbs side of face, wiggling fingers.

We’re grumpy clowns stomping around, 
turning and spinning all over the ground. 
We’re getting kind of dizzy, 
this dance is getting wacked. 
So, take a big bow, cheer and clap!

Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us?
Silly and foolish all day long, 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy?

We’re ferocious fleas flapping around,
turning and spinning all over the ground. 
We’re getting kind of dizzy, 
this dance is getting wacked. 
So, take a big bow, cheer and clap!

Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us?
Silly and foolish all day long, 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy?

We’re kooky kangaroos kicking around,
turning and spinning all over the ground. 
We’re getting kind of dizzy, 
this dance is getting wacked. 
So, take a big bow, cheer and clap!

Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us?
Silly and foolish all day long, 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy?

We’re teeny tiny elephants tiptoeing around,
turning and spinning all over the ground. 
We’re getting kind of dizzy, 
this dance is getting wacked. 
So, take a big bow, cheer and clap!

Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us?
Silly and foolish all day long, 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy?

We’re clumsy ballerinas falling around,
turning and spinning all over the ground. 
We’re getting kind of dizzy, 
this dance is getting wacked. 
So, take a big bow, cheer and clap!

Boom, boom ain’t it great to be crazy? 
Boom, boom ain’t it great to be nuts like us?

Follow the directions in the song.
Stop and Go songs stimulate the frontal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes allow us to set and achieve goals, and have impulse control and empathy for others. Move and Freeze is an action song for children that helps you achieve!
Lyrics:
Chorus:
C’mon, move and freeze. C’mon, move and freeze.
C’mon, move and freeze. C’mon, move and freeze.
Put your right hand on your left knee, 
your left hand on your right.
Your knees move in and out. 
Your hands stay tight.
Now keep on with your moving 
but switch hands on your knees.
Keep on moving in and out till we say freeze.
C’mon, move and freeze. C’mon, move and freeze.
C’mon, move and freeze. C’mon, move and freeze.
Put one hand across your shoulder 
one hand across your back.
Now jump in place. Do you like it like that?
Now switch hands across your shoulders 
and switch hands across your back.
Now just be nimble, just be quick, just like Jack.
C’mon, jump and freeze. C’mon, jump and freeze.
C’mon, jump and freeze. C’mon, jump and freeze.
Everybody shake your body from your head down to your feet.
And don’t stop shaking until we stop the beat.
Shake it to the east and shake it to the west.
Shake it, shake it, shake it with my friends who are the best.
C’mon, shake and freeze. C’mon, shake and freeze.
C’mon, shake and freeze. C’mon, shake and freeze.
Put your right hand on your head, your left on someone’s knee.
Now turn once in a circle and buzz like a bee.
Now turn the other way, don’t let go or lose your spot.
Keep turning left, keep turning right until the music stops.
C’mon, turn and freeze. C’mon, turn and freeze.
C’mon, turn and freeze. C’mon, turn and freeze.
“Alright, you can move now.”

Lyrics
I like to put both arms up in the air
I like to sway back and forth over here and there
I like to jam, jam, jam all around
I like to get up to get down

I like to twist with my friends as the music grooves
I like to feel the beat
Make my body move
I like to jam, jam, jam all around
I like to get up to get down

Everybody get in a dancing line
All together in time
To the right, to the right , to the right, to the right
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the left
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
Roll it down, roll it down, roll it down, roll it down
Crisscross, crisscross, crisscross, crisscross
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise the roof, raise the roof
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up!

I like to put both arms up in the air
I like to sway back and forth over here and there
I like to jam, jam, jam all around
I like to get up to get down

I like to twist with my friends as the music grooves
I like to feel the beat
Make my body move
I like to jam, jam, jam all around
I like to get up to get down

Everybody cool as we move
Stay right in the groove
To the right, to the right , to the right, to the right
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the left
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
Roll it down, roll it down, roll it down, roll it down
Crisscross, crisscross, crisscross, crisscross
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise the roof, raise the roof
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up!
I like to jam, jam, jam all around
I like to get up to get down

Our animated A Tooty Ta song  is super popular children’s song and dance. Students get some fun physical activity,while they rejuvenate their body and brain. Children everywhere love Tooty ta! Tooty Ta is a growing pattern, repeat after me song and dance.

Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student’s attention, giving them a mental and physical break from their academics. This  enables them to have a better focus for learning. 
 Tooty-Ta as a “brain break” is a win-win situation. Students learn during these “brain breaks” plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My  Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.
It’s also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

Dancing Robots
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
℗©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
DANCING ROBOTS 3:57
Directions: This a dance where you imitate a dancing robot. It is performed with small jerks to give the impression of motors 
starting and stopping. Keep your posture stiff at all times. When you are directed to stop, stay as motionless as possible. During
the malfunction imitate a 'broken robot', slowly bend at your waist and then powering up again . The dance concludes with the
'broken robot'. Using exaggerated jerking motions and a look of confusion on your face as you drop towards the ground give the
impression that the robot has completely ceased to function.

Robot: ""Tummy in, shoulders back""
Refrain:
Robots stand still. We'll stand up straight not moving.
We'll move then stop. It's hard to bend that steel.
We're stiff and straight with every little motion.
We're just machines but we certainly look real.
Raise your right hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Raise your left hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. (2X)
Now turn your head to the right a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head to the left a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. (2X)
Robot: ""Stop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a
grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.""
1,2,3,4
Repeat Refrain
Raise your right leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Raise your left leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop CONTINUED NEXT PAGE
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, moving all around. (5X)
Robot: ""Break down, Robot tired, must take rest. See you later.""

Lyrics:
From your seat get the beat. Use your hands and your feet. You know it’s really neat to keep the
beat from your seat. Now clap your hands. Clap your hands. Clap your hands. Clap your
hands. Nod your head, shoulders flexed, listen well
what’s next. Now sway.
Replace clap your hands with stamp your
feet, slap your knees, snap your fingers, and
tap your toes.
From your seat get the beat.

The Penguin Dance uses a growing pattern to teach left and right, following directions, listening skills and develops gross motor movement skills.  We mirror left and right sides to make it easy to follow.  

Brain research suggests that physical activity like engaging in my fun movements songs like Penguin Dance, increases a student’s ability to process and retain new material.

I think brain breaks should be fun! Parent, teachers and kids all love the Penguin Dance.

Brain Breaks including songs like the Penguin Dance help your children rejuvenate and re-focus on learning.

The Penguin Dance is on my Get on Board the Transition Train album.

This Multiply by 2 song has cool original music that is very contemporary and age appropriate for 2nd through 5th graders.  Also, this song goes through each table 1 through 12 three times to give your children a chance for lots of practice.  This Multiply by 2 song also has a gradual learning structure. 

First time: I sing the multiplication table I give the answer.

Second time: I say the table I delay the answer, so children have a chance to answer before me.

Third time: I completely omit the answer so children can answer on their own.

 We take pride in saying that this is one of the best multiplication facts songs around
This song on learning how to Multiply by 2 is a wonderful way for your children to learn and practice the multiplication tables.

Thank you for watching our Subtraction With Regrouping Song.  

 »»-------------¤-------------««»»-------------¤-------------««

Q. Why do we regroup in subtraction?
A. In a subtraction problem, you need to regroup if there are not enough ones or tens to subtract.

Q. What grade levels do this video target?
A. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 4th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS2 (Year 4-5) 

Q. Where did you guys come from?
A. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  

Q. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?
A. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  

During testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.

Q. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?

We have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  

Coming Soon:
1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.

2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  

Research has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.

🍎 Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! 🍎

Our Subtraction With Regrouping video is aligned with the following Common Core  standards:

3.NBT (Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.)

4.NBT (Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.) (subtraction borrowing)",Kids brain break,true

Lyrics
Circle, square, triangle, rectangle, hexagon and rhombus

Circle, square, triangle, rectangle, hexagon and rhombus
These are some 2D shapes move and sing along

Circles are everywhere
A tire has the shape of a circle
It turns round and round

You turn it to drive around

Squares are everywhere
A baseball base has the shape of a square
You run fast to be safe
Some traffic signs have the shape of a square
You see them everyplace 

Triangles are everywhere
A pizza slice can have the shape of a triangle 
It tastes so good to eat
A sailboat sail can have the shape of a triangle
It helps you sail the seas

Rectangles are everywhere
A door can have the shape of a rectangle
It can open and it can close
Our flag is a rectangle
It waves proud wherever you go

Hexagons are everywhere
A honeycomb has the shape of a hexagon
The bees all buzz around
A nut can have the shape of a hexagon
You turn it round and round

Rhombuses are everywhere
A kite can have the shape of a rhombus
You fly it in the air
A diamond can have the shape of a rhombus
It sparkles everywhere

13,WhBfMeL85ak,On the Future of Psychedelic Assisted Therapy with Rick Doblin and Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold,[],"Psychedelic assisted psychotherapy is on track to be the next breakthrough in mental health care. The last decade has seen a renaissance in the field of psychedelic science—moving it from the fringes of the scientific world to the mainstream with startling speed, legitimizing the medical potential of psychedelic drugs. Within the next decade, we are likely to have multiple psychedelic-assisted therapies approved in the US, Europe, and in many countries around the world for the treatment of various mental health conditions. As psychedelic therapy treatment success stories continue to emerge, and new scientific evidence from clinical trials show positive results, more patients will be asking for these treatments. In the coming years, we could see psychedelic therapy used in new treatment centers, psychiatric hospitals, privately owned clinics, as well as with independent practitioners.  

Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been a relentless advocate for developing legal contexts for the beneficial uses of psychedelics for decades and continues to be at the forefront of psychedelic-assisted treatment of PTSD, depression, and mental illness.  

Join licensed psychotherapist and CIIS assistant professor Gisele Fernandes for a fascinating conversation with Rick on the future of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. Diving into his vast knowledge of the science of psychedelics, Rick discusses how drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA affect your brain. He shares how, when paired with psychotherapy, psychedelics could change the way we treat PTSD, depression, substance abuse, and more.  

Discover what the future holds for psychedelic assisted psychotherapy and the treatment of mental health.

Q. Why do we celebrate Halloween.
A. The practices of Halloween mostly come from Celtic paganism in the British Isles, and their feast of Samhain, the new year. They believed it was the time when ghosts and spirits came out to haunt, and the Celts would appease the spirits by giving them treats.

Q. Where did you guys come from?
A. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  

Q. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?
A. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  

During testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.

Q. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?

We have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  

Coming Soon:
1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.

2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  

Research has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.
