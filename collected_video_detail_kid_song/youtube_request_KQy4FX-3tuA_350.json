In the journey, they both come to know that they hail from Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man try to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva) and Seshagiri who is fond of cakes.\n\nKrishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna is survived by his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore) and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a kid but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoil brat often terrorizing people in the name of Anna creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home and kidnaps the woman and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farm house. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for formation of Nandavaram project. Meanwhile Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.\n\nMeanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farm house by Bhushan who trashed her brother recently. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son and none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened seeing them carrying weapons.\n\nFinally during the death rituals of Lakshmi, the main one behind the group is revealed as Ananda Rao.

In the journey, they both come to know that they hail from Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man try to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva) and Seshagiri who is fond of cakes.\n\nKrishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna is survived by his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore) and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a kid but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoil brat often terrorizing people in the name of Anna creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home and kidnaps the woman and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farm house. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for formation of Nandavaram project. Meanwhile Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.\n\nMeanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farm house by Bhushan who trashed her brother recently. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son and none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened seeing them carrying weapons.\n\nFinally during the death rituals of Lakshmi, the main one behind the group is revealed as Ananda Rao. His close associates hold more than 50% stake in Nandavaram project and with that money, he planned to shift to the opposition party and win the elections. Since Anna would oppose it, he wanted to murder him and joins hands with KR and his group. Krishna demands Anna that he would kill Ananda Rao. But Anna requests him and he himself murders Ananda Rao. \n\nRowdy trailer / Rowdy theatrical trailer / Rowdy song trailer / Rowdy movie promo / Rowdy movie songs / Rowdy latest teaser / Rowdy latest trailer / Rowdy platinum disc function / Rowdy audio launch / Rowdy music launch / Rowdy press meet / Rowdy success meet/ Rowdy full movie / Rowdy movie video songs / Rowdy movie dialogues / Rowdy movie Fights."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H54M10S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "38035", "likeCount": "194", "dislikeCount": "19", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "4"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn", "/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "goynN9bikCxCpGuPUYgwn-60ZNQ", "id": "m8RVpPri4BA", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-08-26T15:45:44Z", "channelId": "UCGXHKyKFWJWNd-kb08eAt9w", "title": "Home Alone", "description": "Eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) has become the man of the house, overnight!

But when Levi unexpectedly reaches out to Brianna, he realizes that the only way to begin rebuilding trust is through the only thing that speaks through pain; the healing power of music."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H27M49S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "regionRestriction": {"allowed": ["US"]}, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "xNfjJC0OegmNZyFSauLFMhF3mTs", "id": "PquhNvOrOHU", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-05-25T12:08:32Z", "channelId": "UCNiUT2pbioh2pBrttM4bb5Q", "title": "Fairy alphabet /  ABC songs/ fish, part 1 /  Nursery Rhymes / cartoon for kids, children/FS", "description": "Interesting learning cartoon Fairy alphabet /  ABC songs/ fish, part 1 /  Nursery Rhymes / cartoon for kids, children will train small children letters from A to Z and tell about huge quantity of different fish of our planet.\n*********************************************************************\nForest School is an educational channel for children 12 months + (preschoolers, babies, toddlers) We are going to open world of the numbers,  alphabet, animals, geometric figures, sizes, colors, shapes, seasons of the year and a huge number of interesting things..

Alphabet songs typically follow the alphabetic principle (though the phonics method offers variants). In languages such as English with morphophonemic variation (e.g. \"cake\" is /\u02c8ke\u026ak/, not [\u02c8ka\u02d0k\u025b]), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular pronunciation for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.\n\"The A.B.C.\" /\u02cce\u026a\u02ccbi\u02d0\u02c8si\u02d0/ or \"A.B.Cs\" /\u02cce\u026a\u02ccbi\u02d0\u02c8si\u02d0z/ is one of the best-known English language alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as \"the alphabet song\", especially in the United States.\n\n\nMusic for the alphabet song including some common variations on the lyrics\n\nAlphabet song\nMENU0:00\nTune for Alphabet song\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\nThe song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the Boston-based music publisher Charles Bradlee, and given the title \"The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte\".

Alphabet songs typically follow the alphabetic principle (though the phonics method offers variants). In languages such as English with morphophonemic variation (e.g. \"cake\" is /\u02c8ke\u026ak/, not [\u02c8ka\u02d0k\u025b]), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular pronunciation for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.\n\"The A.B.C.\" /\u02cce\u026a\u02ccbi\u02d0\u02c8si\u02d0/ or \"A.B.Cs\" /\u02cce\u026a\u02ccbi\u02d0\u02c8si\u02d0z/ is one of the best-known English language alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as \"the alphabet song\", especially in the United States.\n\n\nMusic for the alphabet song including some common variations on the lyrics\n\nAlphabet song\nMENU0:00\nTune for Alphabet song\nProblems playing this file?
