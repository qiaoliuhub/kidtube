A good listener becomes the best speaker. Music attracts every living being and education through music is really a good idea. Phonics is the basic sound structure of the alphabet where each letter or  group of letters are given a sound. It helps children to sound out unfamiliar words on their own and improves their reading skills. The focus of teaching early years phonics is on developing children's listening skills. They will be encouraged to mimic and memorize musical and natural sounds, which form the basis of common words, improving pupils' ability to take part separate letters and turn them into whole words. Eg: understanding that cuh-ah-tuh = cat. \nPhonics is essential for children to become successful readers, spellers and writers in the early years of schooling. That is why the official school curriculum says that children need to be taught to read using a systematic phonic system. In pre-school or nursery, even before they start learning letter names and sounds, children begin developing their listening skills so that they are tuned into the different sounds in words. The Department of Education states that deploying a phonics education at an early age can also help children develop children culturally, socially and emotionally.\nResearch shows that phonics when taught correctly is one of the most effective ways of teaching children to learn and read , and can lay a proper foundation for the success of a child .\nReading exercises the brain : Phonics allows children to see letters and provides them with the tools to understand it properly. Beyond reading and writing, it helps children to develop general thinking skills.\nChildren who practice reading often through phonics, get better.\" Practice makes perfect\". It is an important tool for children to develop reading fluency. Children are able to develop into fluent readers. They quickly recognize familiar words and easily sound out new words.\n Sound to symbol recognition becomes faster: A child who learns reading through phonics will have excellent ability to hear, identify, and manipulate letter symbols with their appropriate sound.\nReading builds a child's patience and concentration:  When a child practices reading, they are required to sit still and quietly to focus on reading.  They become better students by following a teacher's instruction over time.\nReading improves grasp of vocabulary and language: Extensive reading helps children broaden their vocabulary and general knowledge. Phonics allows young readers to develop their reading comprehension and decode new as they read. With practice, this action becomes so automatic that they are able to understand the overall meaning of words while they are reading.\nPhonics education helps children be imaginative and empathetic: As children develop their reading skills and learn about people, places and events ,outside of their own experience, they begin to imagine how they would feel in that situation. They see the world with new eyes and can better visualize the descriptions of what they read.\nSounding out unfamiliar words is easier: Teaching phonics allows students to find the regular patterns of words, and connect them for easier reading. Unfamiliar words are easier for children to read and understand.\nChildren learn syllable structure: A  closed syllable will end in a consonant and have a short vowel, while an open syllable will end in a vowel that makes a long sound. English structures become clearer and easier to understand through phonics education.\nHigher reading skills result in better success in school: Through phonics education, children become more active with their reading, which also promotes achievement in other subjects. Children can better grasp other types of knowledge across their curriculum.\nThe learning experience is fun! : Teaching phonics is often designed to be fun and engaging for children. Games and the visuals are often tied to lessons. This approach is meant to enhance the learning experience, and ultimately results in better overall development of reading and writing skills. All children are individuals, each with their own learning styles. Phonics education is one method that can be incorporated into a complete, well-rounded reading program that encourages visual learners to recognize whole words by sight, and creates opportunities for extensive reading and creative writing.
