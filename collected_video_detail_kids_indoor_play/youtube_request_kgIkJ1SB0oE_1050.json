I\u2019ve been working on this video for too long. But, with many people stuck at home, I hustled to finally get it done! I originally started this post with 1-year-olds in mind. That\u2019s how old my little guy is. But, many of these will work for 2 and even 3-year-olds as well.\n\n#momvlog #toddler\n\nSee 13 more learning activities for toddlers: https://youtu.be/qXW7oNtA0Pc\n\nRead the post for more info: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/16-activities-to-do-at-home-with-your-young-toddler/\nRead my review on Lovevery Play Sets: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/lovevery-play-kits-review/\nGet the Lovevery Play Kit Subscriptions: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/recommends/lovevery-play-kits/\n\nTips for Playing with 1-Year-Olds\nModel the Activity: Very often you\u2019ll need to model an activity for a toddler. We can\u2019t always just put it in front of them an expect they know what to do. Show your child the way to play with it and then offer it back.\nParallel Play \u2013 Parallel play can often help extend the length of time your little one plays. Parallel play is when you see two kids playing next to each other but not actually with each other. You can mimic that same thing by \u201cplaying\u201d to encourage them to continue playing with whatever toy they have.\nAt their level tables and shelves \u2013 It\u2019s super helpful to make your space accessible for your little one. Having toy shelves that are right at their level is ideal. It\u2019s also great if you have a toddler-height table for them to use. It\u2019s a little more expensive, but I also really love using a learning tower, which allows kids to stand at counter-height in the kitchen to play and do activities.\n\n\u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b\r\n\r\nWhere else to find But First, Coffee and the creator, Kallie Branciforte: \r\n\r\nMy Blog: www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com\r\ninstagram: www.instagram.com/kallie_branciforte\r\n\r\n\u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.

I\u2019ve been working on this video for too long. But, with many people stuck at home, I hustled to finally get it done! I originally started this post with 1-year-olds in mind. That\u2019s how old my little guy is. But, many of these will work for 2 and even 3-year-olds as well.\n\n#momvlog #toddler\n\nSee 13 more learning activities for toddlers: https://youtu.be/qXW7oNtA0Pc\n\nRead the post for more info: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/16-activities-to-do-at-home-with-your-young-toddler/\nRead my review on Lovevery Play Sets: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/lovevery-play-kits-review/\nGet the Lovevery Play Kit Subscriptions: https://www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com/recommends/lovevery-play-kits/\n\nTips for Playing with 1-Year-Olds\nModel the Activity: Very often you\u2019ll need to model an activity for a toddler. We can\u2019t always just put it in front of them an expect they know what to do. Show your child the way to play with it and then offer it back.\nParallel Play \u2013 Parallel play can often help extend the length of time your little one plays. Parallel play is when you see two kids playing next to each other but not actually with each other. You can mimic that same thing by \u201cplaying\u201d to encourage them to continue playing with whatever toy they have.\nAt their level tables and shelves \u2013 It\u2019s super helpful to make your space accessible for your little one. Having toy shelves that are right at their level is ideal. It\u2019s also great if you have a toddler-height table for them to use. It\u2019s a little more expensive, but I also really love using a learning tower, which allows kids to stand at counter-height in the kitchen to play and do activities.\n\n\u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b\r\n\r\nWhere else to find But First, Coffee and the creator, Kallie Branciforte: \r\n\r\nMy Blog: www.butfirstcoffeeblog.com\r\ninstagram: www.instagram.com/kallie_branciforte\r\n\r\n\u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b \u300b\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.

Jenny went to breakfast with her sister and took Niko Bear with here, so Adley and I are home alone and can do whatever we want and be a load as we want!! Now that we don't need to follow our normal routine, we head upstairs to jump on the bed!! That's fun, but we want to have more fun. So we think of what we can do. Adley has the great idea of going to Rush! It's one of her favorite places because they have games and bounce houses and inflatable horses!\n\nBut guess what, they also have something that Aldey has never done before, roller skating! We decide that now that she's a 4 year old that she can try it for the first time! We get some skates. We get he cutest little skates and put them on Adley. We then have to walk to the indoor skate park and its a struggle muffin! Adley is all over the place, slipping around and doing the splits. I help her over to the rink where we skate around for a while! It's so fun watching her learn new things!!\n\nAfter we've had fun roller skating, we head over to the bounce houses where Adley does all sorts of tricks. I'm in there too, till they kick me out for not being a kid lol! We then head over to the drift carts so Adley can go for a ride and, another first, we try out the ginormous bumper cars. Adley loves them!! We then end our daddy daughter family fun date with Ice cream!\n\nBefore this best day is over, I need pack. I'm a fan of traveling, even though it takes me away from the family, it does give me the opportunity to do something that I really enjoy but don't get a chance to do often, and that's listen to audiobooks! I love learning from other's experiences and trying to improve myself as a person, and Audible has a great selection of books that can help me out. And because of our great friendship with Audible, they sponsored part of this video and I was able to hook you guys up. Follow the link up top and you can get all that free stuff!! go show them so love, they are awesome!

Jenny went to breakfast with her sister and took Niko Bear with here, so Adley and I are home alone and can do whatever we want and be a load as we want!! Now that we don't need to follow our normal routine, we head upstairs to jump on the bed!! That's fun, but we want to have more fun. So we think of what we can do. Adley has the great idea of going to Rush! It's one of her favorite places because they have games and bounce houses and inflatable horses!\n\nBut guess what, they also have something that Aldey has never done before, roller skating! We decide that now that she's a 4 year old that she can try it for the first time! We get some skates. We get he cutest little skates and put them on Adley. We then have to walk to the indoor skate park and its a struggle muffin! Adley is all over the place, slipping around and doing the splits. I help her over to the rink where we skate around for a while! It's so fun watching her learn new things!!\n\nAfter we've had fun roller skating, we head over to the bounce houses where Adley does all sorts of tricks. I'm in there too, till they kick me out for not being a kid lol! We then head over to the drift carts so Adley can go for a ride and, another first, we try out the ginormous bumper cars. Adley loves them!! We then end our daddy daughter family fun date with Ice cream!\n\nBefore this best day is over, I need pack. I'm a fan of traveling, even though it takes me away from the family, it does give me the opportunity to do something that I really enjoy but don't get a chance to do often, and that's listen to audiobooks! I love learning from other's experiences and trying to improve myself as a person, and Audible has a great selection of books that can help me out. And because of our great friendship with Audible, they sponsored part of this video and I was able to hook you guys up. Follow the link up top and you can get all that free stuff!! go show them so love, they are awesome! Ok I'm out of here, have the best day ever!!\n\n\\\\\\\\\nWatch Adley's last video: COPS vs ROBBERS - THE FLOOR IS LAVA CHALLENGE and PRISON ESCAPE at the Park!

But sometimes even a trip to park can turn into an unexpected adventure!\n \nWe will be posting NEW videos to our Dinosaur Channel every Friday.
