Courts should be around 50 feet long and 30 feet wide with walls or fences at either end. \n\nTip\nBasketball courts work well for dodgeball. \n\nStep 2: Start the game\nPosition an equal number of players at either end of the court. Recruit someone to blow a whistle to indicate the start of the game.\n\nStep 3: Get balls\nRush to the centerline to grab as many balls as you can at the start signal.\n\nStep 4: Throw and catch the ball\nThrow balls at players to get them out. If you catch a ball thrown by an opposing player, the thrower is out and a player on your team who has been eliminated can reenter play.\n\nTip\nYou can use a ball in your hands to block balls coming at you, but if you drop the ball you're out.\n\nStep 5: Ending the game\nEnd the game when all players from either team have been eliminated.\n\nDid You Know?\nThe longest dodgeball marathon lasted for 24 hours and two minutes, performed by the New York Epic professional team."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M23S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "181179", "likeCount": "562", "dislikeCount": "34", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "113"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn", "/m/02jjt", "/m/02vxn"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "khcR184J6B_E70NRaxlW4D1sVI8", "id": "sH85vzlgn9o", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-02-04T16:00:03Z", "channelId": "UC1yYkLhWeH7iG7McY_KEcgw", "title": "TRAMPOLINE Flip CHALLENGE with Brothers r Us!!

Right when we walk in we see some of Adley's favorite characters, Princess Fiona and Shrek!! Adley gets some high fives before we head down to the dinosaur area! The kids have tons of fun running round and exploring, while Jenny and I go on the Jurassic World ride!! (Adley was just a little too short to come with us, but next time!!)\n\nWhile Jenny and the rest of the crew go on more rides, Issac and I do our best Mr. Mom routines and keep an eye on the kiddos while we also look for a churro for Adley.\n\nNext up, we head to an animal actors show and the kiddos love it! Dogs, cats, farm animals, birds!! tons of animals doing tricks and being awesome!! it was tons of fun!! It's almost time to head back to the hotel, but first we get the kiddos the worlds biggest donut!

But it makes it all better when your up this early to go on another surprise vacation! We wake up the kiddos and get them all ready before jumping in the purple Tesla to head to the airport. We meet some friends there (mystery guests you could say) and get all settled on the airplane. \n\nA short time later we are in sunny and warm California!! We head to the car to go to the first big surprise and on the walk, we discover a brand new way to carry Niko Bear around hahaha. First stop, Universal Studios! This is Adley very first time here, so she\u2019s taking it all in. She meets up with some animals like Curious George and can\u2019t wait to give him a hug!! We then head to one of Jenny\u2019s most favorite place, probably second after Hawaii, Harry Potter world. We get look at wands, get candy from Honeyduke\u2019s, and then we jump on a ride! They won\u2019t let me film even though I tried, but I got caught!\n\nWe get butter beers to try and they are soooo good. Niko isn\u2019t sure what to think at first, but then he realizes he loves it and doesn\u2019t want to share with anyone anymore!!\n\nAfter having tons of fun at Harry Potter, we go to the rest of Universal, where we see the dinosaur park area with a playground and a brand new playground for Adley to play on. Baby brother would be playing too if he wasn\u2019t fast asleep! We play as long as we can till we\u2019re all tired from getting up early and having a great day!
