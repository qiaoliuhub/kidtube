When they are not using their Jurassic Park Power Wheels to save their Dinosaur friends, they do what friends do, go to the movies, to the beach, to the carnival, to the parks and all sorts of fun places. But sometimes even a trip to park can turn into an unexpected adventure!\n \nWe will be posting NEW videos to our Dinosaur Channel every Friday. And who knows, maybe we will add in a Saturday if our Dinosaur Parks start to fill up. \n\n#Dinosaurs #DinosaurPatrol #Dinosaursforkids", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DK1aVoxc3Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DK1aVoxc3Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DK1aVoxc3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DK1aVoxc3Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DK1aVoxc3Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Dinosaur Patrol", "tags": ["dinosaur", "dinosaurs", "dinosaur adventure", "dinosaurs for kids", "dinosaur park", "dinosaur videos", "dinosaur channel", "jurassic world", "jurassic park", "jurassic adventures", "giant t-rex", "t-rex", "giant life size dinosaur", "tyrannosaurus rex", "Dino Dad", "Dinosaur Patrol", "jurassic park power wheels", "raptor", "Dinosaur Patrol Video", "Dinosaur Patrol Halloween", "Dinosaur Patrol Trucks", "Dinosaur Patrol Dinosaurs", "Dinosaur Patrol Animals", "Dinosaur Patrol Movie", "Dinosaur Patrol Explore", "camp cretaceous"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Dinosaur Patrol Explore Spooky Pumpkin Forest | Halloween Video for Kids (E1) | Dinosaurs for Kids", "description": "Dinosaur Patrol Explore Spooky Pumpkin Forest | A Raptor Halloween Movie Part 1 | Dinosaurs for Kids.

If you're looking for educational, entertaining, safe and family friendly content then subscribe now and join along for all of our Dinosaur Adventures. We want you to be in the Dino Squad and want to teach you about all different dinosaurs around the world so you can learn how you can become part of the Dinosaur Patrol.\n\nThe Dinosaur Patrol will go on Dinosaur rescue missions every week to save the Dinosaurs who are stranded across the country after getting free from Jurassic World. When they are not using their Jurassic Park Power Wheels to save their Dinosaur friends, they do what friends do, go to the movies, to the beach, to the carnival, to the parks and all sorts of fun places. But sometimes even a trip to park can turn into an unexpected adventure!\n \nWe will be posting NEW videos to our Dinosaur Channel every Friday. And who knows, maybe we will add in a Saturday if our Dinosaur Parks start to fill up. \n\n#Dinosaurs #DinosaurPatrol #Dinosaursforkids"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT11M22S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "67799", "likeCount": "126", "dislikeCount": "70", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/02jjt", "/m/02jjt"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "WUulvDvv7dPo2gvJYgoehzdyzOQ", "id": "fo7i-VQ6qqs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-20T10:30:03Z", "channelId": "UCVi_GtP-1stDmhPuWCCQ5KA", "title": "Kite Day -
