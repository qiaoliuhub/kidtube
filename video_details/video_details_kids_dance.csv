Illegal Weapon Lyrics
Ankh surme naa‚Äô laddi hoi naar di
Khinch khinch ke nishane sidhe maardi (x2)

Meri thori bohti daaru aaj lagi sohnea
Thori bohti daaru aaj lagi sohnea
Tahiyon gora mukh hoya ang yaar warga

Mundeya nu sooli utte tangi rakhda
Vayi mera nakhra jo tikhi talvar warga (x4)

Muchhan kundiya karaiyan tere kar ke
High court vich chalde ne parche (x2)

Khake makhan malaiyan hoya vadda balliye
Khake makhan malaiyan hoya vadda balliye
Taiyo rohb rakha filmy star warga

Kudiyan de seene vich than wajda
Ve munda UP de najaiz hathyaar warga (x4)

Meri gall-baat end jatti lit haaniya
Main jaavan do time gym poori fit haaniya
(Do time gym poori fit haaniya)

Ho jidron vi langan mere hon charche
Meri natural beauty kare hit haaniya
(Meri natural beauty kare hit haaniya)

Tere je likhari Garry 36 firde
Tere je likhari Sandhu 36 firde
Munda labhna main Shiv di kitaab warga

Mundeya nu sooli utte tangi rakhda
Vayi mera nakhra jo tikhi talvar warga (x4)

Mere kurte pajame diyan fan goriyan
Mari jandiyan Canada di tan shoriyan
(Mari jandiyan Canada di tan shoriyan)

Ho jiven gudd piche makhiya da jhund firda
Aiven ghumdiya piche ganne diyan boriyan
(Aiven ghumdiya piche ganne diyan boriyan)

Honi kisse naal ajj koi thaki lag di
Kisse naal ajj koi thaki lag di
Hun baneya mahol ji shikar warga

*If you‚Äôre new to my music project: I‚Äôm Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. 

I believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light and precious soundtrack for you.

Many use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.

My music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.

Thank you for listening, liking and loving, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting my music project!

Lyrics 
You're the ant‚Äôs pants,
You can take a chance.
You're the bee‚Äôs knees,
Bold as can be.
You're brave and strong,
The whole day long.

You're the cat‚Äôs meow,
The lion‚Äôs roar.
A bear hug,
And that's not all.
You're strong and brave,
Every single day.

You're beautiful,
You're strong and brave,
You're my hero every day,
And I just want to say,
‚ÄúHey, you're great!‚Äù
Hey you're great!

You're my lucky star,
You know you are.
You're in the top spot,
Hey guess what?
You're brave and strong,
You're my number one.

You're beautiful,
You're strong and brave,
You're my hero every day,

And I just want to say,
‚ÄúHey, you're great!‚Äù
Hey you're great!

You're beautiful,
You're strong and brave,
You're my hero every day,
And I just want to say,
Hey!

You're the ant‚Äôs pants,
You can take a chance.
You're the bee‚Äôs knees,
Bold as can be.
You're brave and strong,
The whole day long.

Hey you're great!
Hey you're great!
 
Further Activities

1. Wishing for superpowers
Use the magic wishing song from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUnOJUW4omU to wish for superpowers.  The children sing the magic wishing song, say the power they would like and then say ‚Äú1, 2, 3 Abracadabra‚Äù to make it come true.

Starlight, starbright,
First star I see tonight.
Wish I may, wish I might,
Have this wish I wish tonight.

2. Musical Capes
Give each child a super cape (coloured scarf) and play the ‚ÄòSuperman Theme‚Äô.  The children fly around with room like Superman, (one fist out to the front and one hand holding the cape over their shoulder so that it falls behind their back).  When the music stops they must go back to earth to rescue someone (sit down on their bottoms as quickly as they can).  Do not eliminate children or make anyone ‚Äòout‚Äô.  Rather, tell the children that you will be watching carefully to see how fast they are at getting back to earth when the music stops.  

3. It‚Äôs a Bird!
See which soft toys you can make fly like Superman.  Place them on the parachute one at a time and say the following rhyme:

It‚Äôs a bird, (gently lift parachute up and down once)
It‚Äôs a plane. (as above)
No, it‚Äôs Superman! (quickly lift parachute up, flinging the toy up high into the air once it‚Äôs on top)",kids dance learning,false

A message from Pradeep Poonia:
Kaushik is in class 2 and is 7 years old. He was the first subscriber to this channel. So he was my first supporter. As a gesture, I have given this channel to him because I believe he alone can teach better coding than billion-dollar companies. Kaushik or his family is NOT related to me. His family is from Odisha and I am from Haryana. 
My opinion on kids learning code: Not all kids should learn to code, it's like dance, a skill set. Every kid has a different skill set. But those who do, they must learn it while enjoying like how Kaushik is doing it. And they must learn it for FREE. You can learn almost everything from the internet for free.

‚òï About Cafe Music BGM channel
We are making Cafe music for relaxation, for work, for study, etc.
All music in this video & in this channel is original music by us.
We are playing all the songs.

üìú What is BGMC?
Morning.
Gentle light that shines through the blinds
One glass of water after waking up
The tender breeze from the window that we feel with all our body

These things are too ordinary in everyday life to be conscious.
But we can't live even if one of them is missing.
""BGMC - BGM channel"" has been providing music, hoping to be like them.

Though it is colorless and transparent, we want to make the listener's daily life as colorful as possible.
That is the essence of the music we deliver.

Light, water, wind, and BGMC
A new value for music.

The biggest fans are elementary students. They are still open to un-inhibited moves and got some pretty good motors skills. Here you are seeing grades K-3rd. This game is called the Cascading WAVE. For details look for this dancing game at the website http://www.muve.com/muve-dancing-games/

I like to use toys to inspire movement ideas. Here each dancer leads one movement to the center and back. The whole group follows ""loosely"" as we say. Sometimes all kids have the same toys (balls, rags, plates), but here we all have a different item. We learn how we can adjust our moves depending on the toy.
There is a whole section about TOYS on the blog http://www.muve.com/blog/dancing-games-with-toys-and-concepts-for-group-exercise-and-fun/

MUVE Dancing Games are great group activities for kids, adults and seniors. And teens and young adults dig these dance activity ideas as well. Check it out here http://www.muve.com/blog/young-muve/

Find out about the MUVE Curriculum (CSPAP - Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program) which you can use for FREE with the help of our website http://www.MUVE.com. This curriculum is also applicable for adults and seniors. MUVE is truly a multi-generational exercise. All ages or skill levels can have fun together, everyone adjusting the improvised dance moves to their own needs.",kids dance learning,false

In this MUVE Dance Lesson, Maggie shows children that dancing the opposites help dancers creatively explore the full range of their movements. The Wave quickly became one of MUVE's favorite exercise activities for kids because of how the whole group can collectively dance and share their dancing ideas altogether. Enjoy over 20 MUVE Dancing Games explained and demonstrated at http://www.muve.com/muve-dancing-games/

The Wave is a group mirroring game, where each side takes turns inspiring the other with new dance moves. The first group collectively chooses a dancing concept that they will dance to the center line. In response, the second group first watches movement, learn it and echo it back. The Wave is a creative tool to reinforce the Opposite Dancing Concepts. In this version, instead of groups echoing the same movements, they will demonstrate the Opposite.  Example- Group 1 chooses to dance stiff and rigid like a robot. Group 2 watches their stiff movements and immediately dances loose and flexible like a noodle. 

MUVE is a free resource on how to dance for kids, adults and seniors. There is also a Dance-Along Video Blog where you can find over 150 low impact dance videos created to serve as desktop exercises to dance along in front of your computer http://www.muve.com/blog/.

Lyrics:
You put your right foot in, you take your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your right arm in, you take your right arm out, you put your right arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you take your left arm out, you put your left arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your head in, you take your head out, you put your head in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your knees in, you take your knees out, you put your knees in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your shoulders in, you take your shoulders out, you put your shoulders in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your elbows in, you take your elbows out, you put your elbows in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your bottom in, you take your bottom out, you put your bottom in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your quiet voice in, you take your quiet voice out, you put your quiet in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.
You put your loud voice in, you take your loud voice out, you put your loud voice in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your tummy in, you take your tummy out, you put your tummy in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your nose in, you take your nose out, you put your nose in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your whole self in, you take your whole self out, you put your whole self in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

Our animated A Tooty Ta song  is super popular children‚Äôs song and dance. Students get some fun physical activity,while they rejuvenate their body and brain. Children everywhere love Tooty ta! Tooty Ta is a growing pattern, repeat after me song and dance.

Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student‚Äôs attention, giving them a mental and physical break from their academics. This  enables them to have a better focus for learning. 
 Tooty-Ta as a ‚Äúbrain break‚Äù is a win-win situation. Students learn during these ‚Äúbrain breaks‚Äù plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My  Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.
It‚Äôs also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

In this video, the hit song from the Jump with Jill show about strong bones, ""The Bone Rap,"" brings the benefits of dairy to life in true hip hop fashion. The nightclub experience has been flipped to celebrate milk by his rapper name, Calcium, and his bone building crew of cheese and yogurt -- the staff dresses as cows who serve up low fat dairy products and the VIP room is reserved for those who get down with healthy bones.

Make your way through all three levels until you master the moves. Then use the audio track to make videos of your own!

How to breakdance
How to bboy

When you do the polka enough, you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs associated with fun, out-of-control wedding receptions.

Step 1: Stand with feet together
Stand with your feet together, knees relaxed. If you're the man, hold the woman along her back with your right arm. If you're the woman, rest your left arm along the man's back, pressing your extended hands together.

Step 2: Step and hop
Step to your left, if you're the man. If you're the woman, step to your right. Each person hops the second step with their opposite foot, the other just coming off the floor. Then bring your feet down next to each other.

Step 3: Reverse step
Draw your partner back with you as you reverse the step with a right, and then a right side hop, setting the left foot down. 

Tip
Take lessons or buy some CDs to get the rhythm down before trying.

Step 4: Spin and hop
Turn out slightly by hopping out on your left if you're the man, and spinning yourself 180 degrees. The woman follows, hopping instead on her right.

Step 5: Swing her
Swing the woman around with you as you hop back now with the right, finishing a circle and bringing her around to starting position as you set both feet down, side by side again. 

Step 6: Start again
Start the steps all over again as you wheel around the floor, hopping on the first notes of each phrase. Remain in sync with the music on each step.

Tip
These steps convert nicely to country western standards. 

Step 7: Get crazy
Put in additional steps wherever you choose as you feel more comfortable. The polka is about letting loose and having fun.

Did You Know?
The word polka is Polish for ""Polish woman.""",kids dance learning,true

 The Ducky Dance lyrics
----------------------------------------
The yard around my house
Is such a pretty space
And when it rains, it‚Äôs wet
So, I jump around the place

Duck down, duck down
And now duck down, again
The little duckies know how
To do the ducky dance

Can you spell out my name
Won‚Äôt you please come out and play
Or, I can find another friend
If you run away

Can you spell out my name
Won‚Äôt you please come out today
Or, I'll find another friend
If you run away

I‚Äôve got, hot chocolate!
Better catch me, if you want it
Raise your hands, raise your hands
When we do the ducky dance

Okay you guys, this next one is super simple. It's a grapevine. I think we've all done the grapevine at some point in our lives. Whether we're at a birthday party, a wedding, wherever you are. A backyard barbecue, yeah, it's popular there. It's very, very simple. And it's just a side to side motion for you to either cool down to or warm up to.  Okay? This is one of those easy recovery steps to add into your workout between something that might be a little more challenging. Okay?

So I want you to start over to the left. You're going to move to the right first. It's three steps, three easy steps. Side, back, side, tap. Side, back, side. Don't cross in front. Side, behind, side, tap. Side, behind, side. Okay? Super basic. Keep this nice and relaxed. Keep this easy up top. One, two, three, tap.

Now, you have it. Take it up to tempo. Not too much faster, but just to get the flow of the grapevine. Okay? Here we go. One, two, three, tap. Two, three. You can do whatever you want with your arms. Right? Don't just stay here like this. Add a little funk to it. One, two, three, tap. Two, three, tap. One, two. Make sure you're crossing behind. One, two, three. One, two, you can even add a little snake of the head. Yeah? I know you've done that before. One, two, tap. One, two, tap. Last one. And hold. Okay?

So, once again, this is a great warmup step or a good cool down step, not something super serious. It's just to relax, to keep your heart rate going, and to keep you moving. Okay?

Have fun.",kids dance learning,true

Victor Sho:  Hi, my name is Victor Sho.

LaShonna Halloway:  And I'm LaShonna.

Victor:  And we are going to show you some simple moves for dancing to house music. And with house, you just want to understand that there is a groove with it, and it's a bounce. Okay? And this bounce is like up and down. Up, yeah?

LaShonna:  Yeah.

Victor:  And then with this bounce, you can do simple movements with your feet, that will, you know, be house steps. So basically we have the cross. Step, step, cross, step, step. So you're going to cross with your right leg over, and place over your left. Then step back with your right, to cross over with your left, to place over your right and then step back with your left. And then you want to go one, two, and three, four, and five, six, and seven, eight, and one. Okay? But now the challenge here is to do it with the bounce. Cool? So you want to go one, two, and three, four, and five, six, and seven, eight, and one. 

And then we have two more dances.

LaShonna:  Alright. This second step that we're going to learn is just a little heel step together. So you're going to keep that same bounce, which is called the jinga. That same jinga, jinga, jinga. You have heel together, heel together, heel together, heel together. Without that little groove, it just looks like this. So you want to add that house groove, that up down motion. Up down, up down. Like you're riding a horse. Awesome. We have one more step that we're going to incorporate into our house dance.

Victor:  This next step is simple. You're going to hop on your left leg, and lift up your right leg, and lift up your left arm. And then you place your right leg down. Hop on your right leg. Lift your left leg up. Place that down. And then you're going to do it twice, hopping on your left leg, and placing your right leg in between each hop. So you hop, boom, boom, and we're going to repeat that. So you're going to go single, single, double, double. Single, single, double, double. Alright? And you still want to keep that same like jinga, as LaShonna said. Yeah? That same up and down movement, and you want to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

LaShonna:  Let's put all three moves together.

Victor:  Yeah.

LaShonna:  And then we'll be doing some house dancing. Ready? Let's start with the step that Victor showed us. We're going to go one, two, three. Then the heel step that I showed you. One, two, three, four. Now the hop step that Victor showed you. Single, single, double. Single, single, double. Awesome.

And that's how you dance to house music.

Victor:  There it is.",kids dance learning,true

¬ªSubscribe to CBC Arts to watch more videos: http://bit.ly/CBCArtsSubscribe

Alberta School for the Deaf vice principal Shelly Prain remembers that when she studied at the National Ballet School, people were surprised that she could dance. Being deaf, the assumption was that she couldn't hear the music ‚Äî and therefore, she'd have a difficult time moving to it.

But Prain points out that dance is about movement, about knowing the rhythm. And she takes apart the stereotype, saying, ""We have deaf doctors, deaf lawyers, deaf dancers ‚Äî we can be anything...I think people need to take down that mindset.""

Enter DanceED Movement Project, a program in Edmonton started by dancers Andrea Gregorio and Krista Deady. The Alberta School for the Deaf is among the many schools they take their empowering dance workshops to. Recently, Gregorio, Deady and a bunch of enthusiastic kids spent a week learning some dynamic routines in a gym equipped with a powerful subwoofer and danced it out, getting ready for a performance in front of their parents and the community at the end of the week.

Lyrics

Do you wanna feel good, 
wanna laugh and play? (let's laugh and play) 
Wanna have some fun, 
throw your blues away? (your blues away) 
Are you feelin' sad? 
Got a problem? - Here's the cure (we got the cure.) 
Do the chicken dance; 
make you happy for sure. 

Reach out your arms and swing your partner. 
Make like a bird and try to fly. 
Come on out there you hens and roosters. 
Just hook your arms now, and don't be shy. 

Hey you're in the swing 
You're cluckin' like a bird. (Pluck, pluck, pluck, pluck.) 
You're flappin' your wings. 
Don't you feel absurd. (No, no, no, no.) 
It's a chicken dance, 
like a rooster and a hen. (Ya, ya, ya, ya.) 
Flappy chicken dance; 
let's do it again. 

Relax and let the music move you. 
Let all your inhibitions go. 
Just watch your partner whirl around you. 
We're havin' fun now; I told you so. 

Now you're flappin' like a bird 
and you're wigglin' too. (I like that move.) 
You're without a care. 
It's a dance for you. (Just made for you.) 
Keep doin' what you do. 
Don't you cop out now. (Don't cop out now.) 
Gets better as you dance; 
Catch your breath somehow. 

Reach out your arms and swing your partner. 
Make like a bird and try to fly. 
Come on out there you hens and roosters. 
Just hook your arms now, and don't be shy. 

Now we're almost through, 
really flying high (bye, bye, bye, bye.) 
All you chickens and birds, 
time to say goodbye (to say goodbye.) 
Goin' back to the nest, 
but the flyin' was fun (oh it was fun.) 
Chicken dance is the best, 
but the dance is done.

Reach out your arms and swing your partner. 
Make like a bird and try to fly. 
Come on out there you hens and roosters. 
Just hook your arms now, and don't be shy.

Dances in cheerleading are always to eight counts. And no matter where you're learning a dance for cheerleading, knowing how to learn a dance is very important. Step one. Start off by learning the first four counts of the dance. And once you have those, you can move on and learn the next four. Remember to count out loud.

Alright. So we're going to start this one off to the side and we're going to hold. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. We're going to hit a high beat on one. We're going to swing it around on two. Punch it three. We're going to clean to the side on four. Do you have that much? Okay. From here, we're just going to hit five. Bring it down to our knee on six. Pull it back up on seven. And then back down on eight.

Step two. Now that you know the first eight count of the dance, start from the beginning, go through the entire first eight count, and then add on four more counts. So moving on from here we're going to clean on one. We're going to punch it up on two. We're going to punch it across on three. And then we're going to bring it up on four. Continue doing this pattern of starting from the beginning, adding on four more counts, until you get to the very end.

Step three is to do the dance full out to counts. Now that you know all of the moves for all of the counts, you can start from the beginning, and count out loud, until you make it from the beginning to the end, several times. Alright. Let's do this one all the way through. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

Step four is dance to the music. Listen to the track a couple of times, and know exactly when the first count of the dance starts. And this how you learn a cheer dance.",kids dance learning,true

Ava:  Hi everybody. I'm Ava. This is my sister Loretta and this is Anthony. Right now we're going to show you some three basic moves on how to dance to hip-hop music. The main thing with hip-hop I guess is just be, like, relaxed and, like, have fun. Not too serious. Like you don't want to stand up too straight because you'll be, like, stiff, you know. You're going to stand basically, like, shoulder width apart with your feet and your knees are going to bent a little bit. This is pretty much where you live and where you start with all of your hip-hop grooves. 

The first hip-hop groove Loretta is going to take us through.

Loretta:  We can do just a basic kick-ball-change. You're going to take one foot, you're just going kick in front. Then you're going to cross it over. Then the back foot is going to step back. Then you're going to do the same thing. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. Kick, step, back. When you double time it, here we go. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. 

You could also add a little bounce to it, to the beat. That's the relaxed, chill mood of hip-hop. Let's do it again. Five, six, seven, eight. One-and-two, three-and-four, five-and-six, seven-and-eight. Awesome. Next move.

Anthony:  Sweet. Now we're going to break into the slide and step. We're going to slide and hit, slide and hit. And hit. Now if you want to get some more energy it's going to be a hop, and hop, and hop, and hop. Now let's put that together. To the right. Five, six, seven, eight. Slide and hop, and hop, and hop. Awesome

Ava:  I'm feeling hip-hoppy already. OK, so one more move we're going to show you is just basically you're going to stand shoulder width apart and your hands are going to come out and then come in and then come out and then come in. While you do that your hips are going to move with it. They're going to go out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in. Right? We're going to start together and then we're going to jump out as we do this and add a little bit of bounce to it. Five, six, seven, eight. Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in. Awesome.

Loretta:  Those are three basic steps that you can do to dance to hip-hop music. Go through them one more time. First one, kick-ball-change. Five, six, seven, eight. Kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change, kick-ball-change. 

Anthony:  Now we have the slide hop. Five, six, seven, eight. Slide, slide, slide, slide.

Ava:  Awesome. And the last one. Your arms go out and in with the hips. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

That's how you dance to hip-hop music.",kids dance learning,true

Learn how to dance on beat with this dance video from Howcast.

Loretta: Hi, everybody. My name is Loretta and this is my sister, Ava. We're the Double-Time Twins, and today we're going to teach you how to dance on beat. So the first thing you should remember when you do this is basically just listen to the music and get into the groove of the music. The easiest thing you could do is clap. So when you hear your instructor or someone talk . . .

Ava: Wait. When you hear your instructor, or if you're ever taking class and they count to eight, that's what they're counting. They're counting the beat. So they go, ""One, two, three, four . . .""

Both:  "". . . Five, six, seven, eight"". 

Loretta:  They're doing that to help you so you can dance on beat. 

Ava: On beat. 

Loretta: So I can do that, and Ava, you could do a dance move so they could see what it's like to dance on beat. 

Ava: Okay. 

Loretta: So we got five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Awesome. That is how you dance on beat.",kids dance learning,true

21,LokSdbsrYv0,Kids Dance Challenge 2020,[],"This June, we are launching our brand-new DANCE CHALLENGE and we would LOVE for you and your school to get involved!

We know things have been tough recently, so our aim throughout this challenge is to bring families together, create happy memories and have plenty of fun along the way. 

Children big and small are invited to take part and create their very own dance video where anything goes! ü§™

The only rule is to have LOTS OF FUN!

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

- Each week children are given a theme
- Using that theme, they create their own dance routine - use our videos for inspiration, create something totally wacky and unique, or just dance along with us!
- Create a video of the performance (no fancy camera‚Äôs needed ‚Äì a phone is fine!)
- Ask parents to post the video onto social media using our hashtags.
- Get sharing and liking: the video with the most likes each week WINS!

SO, WHAT DO YOU WIN?

The purpose of this challenge is to have LOADS OF FUN‚Ä¶ but we want to dish out some prizes too!

‚úÖ A challenge is not a challenge without a certificate ‚Äì so EVERY CHILD who submits a video will get a downloadable certificate to put on their bedroom wall!

‚úÖ Instant stardom - videos will be seen by thousands every day on our social media channels and there's the possibility of earning a fortune as the next internet sensation! üòâ

‚úÖ And because every child LOVES a trophy, the ‚ÄúDance Superstar‚Äù who gets the most likes will receive a SHINY TROPHY to keep forever! Plus a FREE DANCE SUBSCRIPTION for their school (worth ¬£495)

READY TO FIND THE NEXT DANCE SUPERSTAR?

Below are the weekly themes - the links can be shared with your children and include more detail about each challenge, an imoves video for inspiration and a music file!

- Samba (starts 8 June): https://imoves.com/home-learning/1545
- Hip Hop (starts 15 June): https://imoves.com/home-learning/1546
- Disco (starts 22 June): https://imoves.com/home-learning/1544
- Bollywood (starts 29 June): https://imoves.com/home-learning/1547

Join us in this challenge and let's bring families together, have lots of fun getting active, and create happy memories that will last a lifetime. 

I really hope this provides some much needed focus and entertainment for your children.  

Happy dancing,

Imogen

P.S. This challenge is not just for kids! Why not get all your teachers and parents involved too? You could even have a dance off to see who gets the most likes :-)

P.P.S. First up is our Samba Challenge which starts on 8th June but kids can get started NOW - share this link (https://imoves.com/home-learning/1545) with children and their parents and let‚Äôs get EVERYONE involved. Have fun!",kids dance learning,true

Hi and welcome to today's dance class
with moi Leroy und Joachim the disciple

Today we are going through moves such as
Bicycle Pump und Put in Bag

But we start with just legs
Simple stomping
stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp
stomping, stomping, stomping, stomping
stomping
As I said - Just Legs

Und then we have the Small Ball
like this - small ball, small ball
Remember to keep your knees bouncing
right, left, right, left, right, left
Big Ball!
Big ball, both balls - this is Both Balls
works very well with the mafia, ja

Und then we Pick the Apples in this fashion
The shrooms they are a-coming!
pick the apples, pick the shrooms
this is the transition
pick the apples, pick the shrooms
easily done

Und then we have the Bicycle Pump
makes a good impression from the side
Intense!
And pump

We are starting to get it!

Wash the Laundry
wash the laundry
wash the laundry

and stomp

Welcome to the second part - the hard part
where we go loose proper psychedelic

We start with The-Hard-Ping-Pong-Move
the-to-be-continued-thing, OK?
Here it is - as follows
we Serve - The Psychedelic Eyes
and start to Go Loose - go loose!
And Play the Ping-Pong - serve!
There it is! Serve the Ping-Pong

When you know all those easy things
it is time to Walk the Dog, right?
Like this - not hard at all, is it?
But!
Like a real psychonaut in a psychedelic spirit
you will first have to Pet the Dog
pet the dog, pet the dog
Almost like Ping-Pong but remember to
Pet the Dog when you Walk the Dog
Pet and walk the dog!
Easily done - pet and walk the dog
The hand behind your back!
pet the dog and walk the dog

After the dog we have the cow and the bull
very hard moves
Keep your knees bouncing - to the sides
relax your shoulders!
Milk the Cow
There it is - you can handle it!
Milk the cow
That was Milk the Cow
since it is called the Cow and the Bull
there must be a bull aswell, right?
A little bit like this
remember the eyebrows and the knees
The eyebrows!
A fixed firm gaze towards your partner
milk it, milk it, milk it
like that
Milk the Cow and Milk the Bull

Our last move is the Chernobyl Child
with the hand in its neck!

Thanks

And that's how you dance at a party :)

Loretta:  Hey, everyone, what's up?  My name is Loretta. This is my sister, Ava. We're the Double Time Twins.  And today we're going to teach you to dance by yourself. So the two main things to remember when you're dancing by yourself is to just have confidence and have fun doing  whatever it is you're doing.  The cool thing about dancing by yourself is that you don't have to do somebody else's rhythm. You don't have to work.

Ava:  So if Loretta's in a slow kind of groove, but you don't feel like doing that groove, that's totally fine because you're dancing by yourself.  So whatever groove you want to do, you can do. Okay, so Loretta's going to demonstrate how you can dance by yourself on the dance floor. So, since you have the entire dance floor by yourself, you're not going to stay in one box, right?  

Loretta:  Right.

Ava:  So, Loretta's going to show you how to dance in a box. No, a little box. Like if you didn't have the whole dance floor, you would just stand in a box like this, because there's other people around you, right? But you have the whole dance floor to yourself because you're dancing by yourself. So, you're going to use it.  So, dance in a big box, like you have the whole dance floor, right?

Loretta:  Alright.

Ava:  Okay, so we go, step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  So, we can go to the side first.  Side, together. Then you can take it back. Back, together. Take it to the other side. Side, together. Then take it back up front. Stop, Front, together. Awesome, let's do that again. Five, six, seven, eight.  Step, together, take it back. Take it side. Take it front. Awesome. Alright, so, let's do that faster as if we have the whole dance floor together.

Loretta:  Well, you want to do that because I'm dancing by myself?

Ava:  Right, Loretta can do it because she's dancing by herself. Five, six, seven, eight.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  One, two, three, you can turn while you're doing it, too. Awesome, six, seven, eight. Remember, just have fun, own it, love it. You're dancing by yourself, it's your own groove.",kids dance learning,true

Alright, here are a couple of my favorite old school jazz funk moves. The first one is a little rock step. Let's do the lower body first. Up, up, down, down, up, up, down, down, up, up, down, down. The upper body rocks it out with the shoulders. Let's put it together. And we're going. Up, up, down, down, up, up, down, down, up, up, down, down. 

You can just rock that and have a really good time with it. Next old school jazz move is, I call it the king of VOP step because Frank Hatchett originally did it. And feet go in, one heel, the toe comes up, and then the inside toe goes up on rowan. Then you reverse it. Toes in, one toe up, then the heel on the other leg. Then you keep going. Up, down, and up. It's a little bit trickier than it looks, but it's a lot of fun to do once you get going and then you work it out a little bit faster. Good. So breaking that down again, feet go in, toe heel, feet go in, toe heel.

Alright, that's king of VOP step. Next one is like a jump, jump rock. So, we're going to go jump, jump, jump and rock, jump, jump, jump and rock. A little bit slower. You're just pushing your hands up, really fun party, go jump, jump, keep your knees nice and soft and pick up your foot, pop your shoulders and step it out. One more time to the left. Jump, jump, jump and rock. And five, six, seven eight. Up, up, down... move it back, king of VOP, in and rock it out. Move it back. Good. Jump it out. Ready and. And those are just a couple old school funk jazz moves for you",kids dance learning,true

Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star
How I wonder what you are

Shine Shine, Little Sun
You shine when the night is done
Make the heavens fill with light
Chase away the lonely night
Shine Shine, Little Sun
Now you're out, let's have some fun

Jump Jump, Jump so high
See if you can touch the sky
Jump to the left, jump to the right
Push your feet with all your might
Jump Jump, Jump so high
Jump so high you touch the sky

Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star
I'm a star like you
I can move and I can groove
I can twinkle, too!

Spin Spin, Spin around
Wobble Wobble, don't fall down
When you spin you might get dizzy
Spinning keeps your feet so busy
Spin Spin, Spin around
Wobble Wobble, Whoops! Fell down.

Clap Clap, Clap your hands
Clapping loudly is so grand
Clap up high, clap down low
Clap so fast and then clap slow
Clap Clap, Clap your hands
Lots of clapping's what we planned

Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star
How I wonder what you are

What are you?
Well, you're sure cute",kids dance learning,true

Learn how to dance to rock music with this dance video from Howcast.

Loretta:  Hey everybody, what's up?  My name's Loretta. This is my twin sister, Ava. This is Anthony. Today, we're going to teach you how to dance to rock music. So the basic thing that you want to do when you're listening to rock, if you're at a concert, if you're at a club or anything, is basically, just to feel the beat in your attitude, right?  So when you're in it, what do we all do when we hear rock music?  

Anthony:  Raise our arms.

Loretta:  Our arm is up and that's what you do. As cliche as it might possibly be, that's what feels good and that's just kind of like how your body goes. So one arm is up and your head goes with it and your arm pulses front; one two, three, four; add a bounce; five, six, seven, eight.

Anthony:  And another thing you guys want to keep in mind, is that you don't want to just wave your arms around like you don't care. But if you stay on beat and really feel the pulse, people around you are going to pick up on that, and you're going to look like a cool guy or girl.

Loretta:  And you're going to be rocking out. It's going to be awesome. Another move that we could do is the air guitar.

Ava:  The air guitar.

Anthony:  The air guitar, so our air guitar is a simple two-step, which is rock and hit, rock and hit, rock and hit, rock and hit.  Now you can bring it low, if you want. We can rock and hit low, rock and hit low, rock and hit low, rock and hit low. Or you can bring it up and you can slap the face and put it over your head even, and we're rocking it high, rocking it high, rocking it high, rocking it high.

Loretta:  Awesome, so those are two simple dance moves that you can do to rock the music, to rock out with your friends.",kids dance learning,true

Hippo wants to dance.
She jumps up and down on the dusty ground.
THUMP!
THUMP!

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting dirt on me!‚Äù
says Shongololo, sleeping in the sand.
‚ÄúGo dance somewhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making me wet!‚Äù

‚ÄúGo dance somewhere else.‚Äù

Hippo wants to dance.
She flops into a puddle of mud and slides around on her nice big belly.
SQUISH!

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stop dancing?‚Äù
asks Donkey, carrying his buckets.
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you do something useful instead?‚Äù

Hippo is sad.
She is too sad to dance.
She sits on a rock and cries.
The tears roll down her cheeks and fall on the ground.!

Let Virtual Reality transform your room into a dance studio!

Dancing is fun, but learning to dance is challenging!

Dance moves any time, any speed, from all angles
Try new dance styles without breaking the bank
Avoid the hassle, enjoy the benefits

Enjoy dance lessons at home with Virtual Reality, almost as if you were attending a real dance class. Work on your dance choreography to make your routine really shine. Learn new body movement styles, including health and fitness like yoga and pilates.

For our selection of social partner dances, we have Latin styles like Salsa and Bachata, swing dances like East Coast Swing and West Coast Swing, and Argentine Tango.

Traditional dances include international ballroom (Waltz, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz, Quickstep, Tango) and international latin (Rumba, Cha-cha, Samba, Jive, Paso doble).

WHY DANCE VIRTUAL?

*Immersive*

Learn dancing by dancing, not watching! Immerse yourself in Virtual Reality to recreate a social event, a group lesson, private lesson teaching, a performance hall, and multiple other locations.

*Convenient*

Avoid traffic, scheduling conflicts, time availability, class costs, and having to put on pants. Learn at your own pace in the comfort of your own home. Review steps on your mobile device.

*Efficient*

Your favorite moves, any time, at any speed, from all angles. Review steps and styling from any angle, practice without a partner, try a new dance style or fast forward to new patterns.


*** Dancing. Virtually. For Real. ***

Our virtual reality (VR) product brings fun back into dancing by eliminating scheduling, getting ready, going through multiple changes of clothes, fighting the weather, finding a sitter for your lovely kids or your furry pets, driving at rush hour, getting stuck in traffic, finding parking, being on time, paying class fees, feeling beginners anxiety, finding practice time, memorization, taking notes and recording video.

Ever hoped that you could rewind your brain to that one class where they taught that one move you really like? Well, now you can! Practice as much as you like and take as long as you want. You won‚Äôt be holding the rest of the students back. Or, if you are bored with the current lesson and want to challenge yourself, jump ahead a few lessons.

If you need some reassurance before you step into a real dance floor, we‚Äôre here for you. Not everybody is born dancing, some have to learn the hard way. And for the rest of us, Dance-Virtual makes us learn the easy way.

My name is Maegan Woodin, and I'm  a professional dancer, choreographer, teacher and student. I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. A pirouette in Ballet is a turn that is very commonly found on the basic to intermediate level. The amount of turns depends on the skill of the dancer. So you can start off by just doing a passe in Releve to doing a half turn, to doing a full turn, to doing two, three, four. And for male dancers they can do up to ten pirouettes at a time. So it is important to think about the alignment and the position of your fourth position, which most pirouette's start in. So if you stand in fourth position, again your fourth position shouldn't be too wide, it should be pretty small and your weight should be evenly between both legs. Your arms are going to open up, one arm is to the side one arm is in front. You are going to start in a plie position. When you plie you are going to open up both arms, that is going to be the start of your plie and the start of your pirouette. You are going to open up your arms then bring them together and your foot is going to come passe. So again you are going to plie, open up your arm and everything is going to zip up into passe. And that is the very basic level. And you turn it when you become more advanced. I am now going to demonstrate how to do a pirouette turn, I am going to do a single turn and then I am going to do a double turn.Now I am going to demonstrate a double pirouette.",kids dance learning,true

‚ùì WHAT IS A MUSIC TABLEPLAY ‚ùì

üí†Ideal for toddler-early elementary age kids  
üí†On and Off-the-Folder game & activity suggestions

Additional Information:
üéµ  Why Music?
Being involved in regular active music-making is one of the absolutely BEST things for a child's development. Skyrocket development and learning with active, consistent musical play.

üéµ  Why Music TablePlays?
Whether toddler, kindergartener, or early elementary, your kids will love music tableplays! Easily entertain, educate, and engage your children!
Music tableplay folder games are designed to help children easily integrate music into everyday life in simple, easy, fun and educational ways. Music tableplays encourage parents (or caregivers) and children to make music together in a playful, problem-solving setting. As children play, they solve problems and feel the music in their body. When they sing, they demonstrate the song is becoming internalized and that they are becoming ready for further study and more advanced musical play.

Anybody can put one foot in front of the other but the key to really dancing well is following the rhythm of the music. Each song has an underlying pulse that marks time and common beat for all instruments. In this dance along video, students have the opportunity to experiment accentuating the common beat of the song, by slowing down and speeding up movements. In MUVE the beat is identified by acknowledging the most common 4 count. 
 The Wave is a group mirroring game, where each side takes turns inspiring the other with new dance moves. The first group collectively chooses a dancing concept that they will dance to the center line. In response, the second group first watches movements, learn it and echo it back. In this version, the dancing concepts are given by a caller on each side pensive. The Caller uses the beautifully designed MUVE Animation Cards to to give visual reference for dancers.
      MUVE's Dancing Games are great school exercises for kids and teens. You can MUVE in between subjects to refresh body and  mind or implement the MUVE School Curriculum with your group. You can find the various MUVE Dancing Games Instructions, the MUVE School Curriculum and our Dancing Inspiration Cards at www.muve.com",kids dance learning,false

Watch my TEDx talk about how I learned: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gh1d...

----
People who watch me dance today sometimes assume I've been dancing for many years. I made this video so you could see the awkward body that started just one year ago.

Here's my secret: I practiced everywhere. At bus stops. In line at the grocery store. At work ‚Äî Using the mouse with my right hand and practicing drills with my left hand. You don't have to train hardcore for years to become a dancer. But you must be willing to practice and you better be hungry.

This isn't a story about dancing, though. It's about having a dream and not knowing how to get there ‚Äî but starting anyway. Maybe you're a musician dreaming of writing an original song. You're an entrepreneur dying to start your first venture. You're an athlete but you just haven't left the chair yet.

When you watch someone perform, you're seeing them at the top of their game. When they score the winning point or sell their company for millions ‚Äî you're seeing them in their moment of glory. What you don't see is the thousands of hours of preparation. You don't see the self doubt, the lost sleep, the lonely nights spent working. You don't see the moment they started. The moment they were just like you, wondering how they could ever be good.

There's been some debate as to who was the first person to start the dab craze, although Migos and PeeWee Longway have definitely received some of the credit. Recently, the origin of dabbing even became the cause of an argument on social media between Quality Control members, OG Maco and Migos. Whatever the case may be, dabbing is popular and will soon transcend daily language usage, probably not so unlike twerking, the shmoney dance etc.

Rich The Kid, another Quality Control/Migos affiliate, is also a dabbing enthusiast. When we had him by the office recently, he gave us a quick tutorial on how to properly dab-- so now everyone can get in on the fun, even Patrick. The sneeze method is key.

‚ÑπÔ∏è It‚Äôs good to know that the original name of that small brownie is pronounced by small kids as #booba, #boba, #–±—É–±–∞, #bobby, #bobba, #bupa, #–±–æ–±–∞, #buba, #–±–∞–±–∞, #bobaa, #ÿ®Ÿàÿ®ÿß, #bubba, #baba, #duba, #boombah and even #Ô∫èÔªÆÔ∫ëÔ∫ç.

Who is Booba?
Booba is cute and inquisitive, like a five-year-old kid. He explores the world without anger or resentment, only joy and wonder. He doesn't talk, although he does make sounds to express his emotions.

Nobody knows where he came from, but he has obviously missed the last 100 years of human progress and explores modern locations with boundless energy and enthusiasm. His awkward movements, combined with a strong desire to learn more about the world around him, often have hilarious results! However, this doesn‚Äôt satisfy Booba‚Äôs curiosity, so his adventures will continue in the upcoming series.

LYRICS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY 
I like to lay in the grass
And look up at the sky
Watch the clouds above
Even a rainbow sometimes

I see a kite fly by
And I say hi  (‚Äòhello kite!‚Äô)
Come on and spread your wings
So we can take flight 

Then I fly, fly, fly like a kite
I feel strong, strong, strong as a tiger
And as big, big, big as a giraffe, so high, wohoho
And I jump, jump, jump like a kangaroo
Swim, swim, swim, I come up to you
I take, take, take you by the hand
If that‚Äôs OK, and I say

4x
It‚Äôs
Such a beautiful day, lalalalala
Such a beautiful day, lalalalala
Such a beautiful day, lalalalala
Such a beautiful day, lalalalala

Hi, my name is Victor Sho.

And, I'm LaShauna. 

And we are gonna teach you how to do upper body isolations. So, basically, when you're doing the upper body isolation, you want to understand that your neck is the tool that would pretty much engage the isolation to which part of the body you want to use. 

So, if you want to isolate your head, you want to extend your neck towards your right, then your left. Your right, then your left. Yeah? However you want to keep your torso area completely still. And a lot of times people try to put their hands on their chest so that they can feel that their torso is, and your chest area, this whole upper body area right here, is not moving. 

So, you want to go right, left, right, left. And if you realize the more you practice this, the more your neck gets loose, the more you'll be able to move your head from side to side without doing one of these. You don't want to lead with your chin. You don't want to that. Want to keep your head completely still and vertical and keep your shoulders completely flat, so none of this, yeah? 

So, keep your shoulders completely flat and then isolate your head. And then that same token, you can keep your head still and isolate your actual upper body itself from your chest area. So, you can keep your head still right here, and move your chest to your left, your chest to your right. Your chest to your left, your chest to your right. And you work with it just like that. Cool? 

And then, when you get advanced and you want to have fun with it, what you can do is you can start doing different things where you can isolate your head first, then your lower body. First, then your lower body, top, lower body. Great, encircle it. And then you'll bring it right back up. 

If you realize, a lot of times what I also use, to kind of like cheat that, is, if my body is going towards my left, my chin is kind of going towards my right. If my body is going towards my right, my chin is kind of going towards my left. In the same token, if my head is going down, my upper body is going up. 

And it's the same thing. If my upper body's going up, my head is going down. Cool? And that's how you do upper body isolations.",kids dance learning,true

In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.

Petersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.

Strangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right-hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).

In Dance The Night Away, you'll learn how to dance in any social situation. You'll learn everything from how to slow dance, to how to dance as a couple, to the spins, dips, and turns that will sweep your partner right off their feet.

This slow dance lesson shows you just one of the moves you'll learn in this jam packed DVD and it reveals the simple, easy to learn way of learning how to slow dance.

Most instructional dance videos teach formal ballroom dancing routines that can take years to master and which can look strange out on the dance floor. Most beginners want to learn how to dance socially. how to slow dance with that special someone, and how to dance smoothly and naturally without looking like they are trying to hard. 

Instead of teaching you formal dance steps, our DVDs focus exclusively on slow dancing, on partner dancing, on spins, and dips, and turns that are based on latin and swing dance styles without diving into the outdated patterns.  

When you watch our easy dance lessons, you'll not only learn how to slow dance, but you'll learn how to dance confidently and easily and how to just dance the night away in any social situation, without ever worrying about your dance moves again.

‚òÖ Lyrics

Sing boom bodi boom boom!
Boom bodi boom boom!
Sing boom bodi boom pa boom!
Boom bodi boom pa boom!

Down in the jungle 
where nobody goes 
there's a great big gorilla 
washing his clothes
with a swish swash here 
and a swish swash there.
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

Down in the jungle 
where nobody goes
there's a slithery snake 
washing his clothes
with a swish swash here 
and a swish swash there.
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

Boom bodi boom boom!
Boom bodi boom boom!
Boom bodi boom pa boom!
Boom bodi boom pa boom!

Down in the jungle 
where nobody goes
there's a great big crocodile 
washing his clothes
with a swish swash here 
and a swish swash there.
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
Boom bodi boom boom 
boogie woogie boo!
That's the way 
he washes his clothes.

- Lindy Hop Footwork 0:38
- Side-to-Side (Open Position) 1:21
- Front-to-Back (Side-by-Side Position) 0:55
- He-Goes/She-Goes (Side-by-Side to Closed Position and back) 2:45
- He-Goes back to Side-to-Side 3:31
- Level 1 Lesson 1 Pattern 3:45

PRONOUN NOTE:
The use of pronouns ""he"" and ""she"" across Lindy Ladder are used in a context of lead and follow, respectively, and not an inference of human gender. Lindy Ladder is a proud supporter of LGBQT rights, and most of our dancers learn both roles in the dance. Remove gender bias from the interpretation, and simply focus on the role you play in the vocabulary. Enjoy dancing! 

CURRICULUM NOTE:
The Lindy Hop is taught in many ways, because it's what is commonly referred to as a ""street dance."" When it was created, there was no curriculum, or set way of doing anything really. Frankie Manning himself once commented ""what's a triple step?"" after being asked about the ""basic step."" Lindy Hop has been around in this generation longer than it was after its initial inception and subsequent obscurity. This dance now grows, learns from itself, changes itself. As instructors we always want to stay true to its roots, dancers will find that there are many ways instructors go about teaching how to do this historical dance. Here is one that has worked for many thousands of dancers, and we recommend as a student that you learn from as many others as you can to get the full ""street dance"" influence, and join the conversation! 

Taught by Award Winning Instructor - Shauna Marble 
Lindy Hopping since 1995, for many years with Frankie Manning himself!

Lyrics: 
‚ô´ Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones. 
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Doin' the skeleton dance.

The foot bone's connected to the leg bone.
The leg bone's connected to the knee bone. 
The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. 
Doin' the skeleton dance.

The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone. 
The hip bone's connected to the backbone. 
The backbone's connected to the neck bone. 
Doin' the skeleton dance.

Shake your hands to the left.
Shake your hands to the right.
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands out of sight. 
Shake your hands to the left.
Shake your hands to the right.
Put your hands in the air.
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle...wiggle your knees. 

Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dancing bones.
Doin' the skeleton dance. ‚ô´

Learn the tap dance 'alphabet' in a fun, clearly instructed video that includes basics, exercises, and a fun dance combination!   The video is structured into two Levels, each level is 30 minutes in length (both levels are included in this video!): 'Level 1' is a 30 minute class teaching the ultimate basics of tap dance, taught from the ground-up.  No experience is required.  We focus on simple footwork such as steps, touches, stamps, shuffles, and more. 'Level 2' is a 30 minute class that continues where Level 1 left off, and introduces more challenging steps such as creating groupings of the basic steps.  Each 30 minute class ends with a dance combination.  The dance combination in Level 2 picks up where Level 1 finishes, so that if you work through both levels you will have learned a full dance combination.  www.tapdancemadeeasy.com",kids dance learning,false

Here are step by step instructions on how to do the hoe down throw down dance. 

Once you learn the dance, see our full version of the Hannah Montana Hoedown Throwdown Miley Cyrus Dance to music. (see our youtube channel: fitforafeast)

We do the break down of all the steps, but you can pause and rewind as you need to learn it at your own pace.  We do it pretty slowly and break it down step by step because many people find the Miley tutorial goes too fast.  It is easiest to learn the dance at a slower speed.  As you get the steps, practice it at a faster speed and then try it with the music or along with the video.  You can even take some of these steps and use them in other line dances to country songs.

You can see us doing the steps to the Hoedown Throwdown song here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ucTK3eB4Q

Here is a dance we did to the Party in the USA song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yed-u_BeM1Q

Check out our channel for many other tutorials and dance performances: http://www.youtube.com/fitforafeast

You can also get updates and see photos of us now (we are much older).  We are still Miley Cyrus fans - even though she has left Hannah Montana behind!

Spooky Spooky Song Lyrics: 

Do the Spooky Spooky!

You put your orange hand in,
Orange hand out,
Orange hand in,
And shake it all about.

Do the Spooky Spooky
And turn around.
Every body shout,
BOO!

You put your black hand in,
Black hand out,
Black hand in,
And shake it all about.

Do the Spooky Spooky
And turn around.
Every body shout,
BOO!

You put your orange foot in,
Orange foot out,
Orange foot in,
And shake it all about.

Do the Spooky Spooky
And turn around.
Every body shout,
BOO!

You put your black foot in,
Black foot out,
Black foot in,
And shake it all about.

Do the Spooky Spooky
And turn around.
Every body shout,
BOO!

You put your head in,
Head out,
Head in,
And shake it all about.

Do the Spooky Spooky
And turn around.
Every body shout!

Simple, fun and educational songs for kids. Great for toddlers, preschool and kindergarten children as well as the ESL and EFL classroom. 

All of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don‚Äôt realize that they‚Äôre learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.

Our unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you‚Äôre sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.

Alright you guys this next one is a favorite of mine. It's called the Quick Feet. It's fast feet moving to the side and you're working out your cardio. Ok? So don't stress out about the feet being complicated. It's super simple. It's just side to side. So start with your toes and your knees facing in the same direction. Now you're going to do right left to the side, like this. Ok? Then left right to the other side. That's it. Ok, imagine you're trying to dodge something. Quick get out of the way. Quick feet. Quick feet. Yes? Quick feet. Channel your inner football player, right? You know how they're moving fast and they run their feet. So get that but add the hip hop sense to it, ok? So left right, right left. Left right. Right left. Now we're gonna add the rhythm in the upper body to it, as well. So there's a pause between each side. OK? So you're gonna do right left, chest pop or open close and chest pop right here. Quick feet. Open close. Quick feet. Open close. OK? If that's to much, just quick feet, hold, quick feet, hold.Ok? We're gonna take it up in tempo because I want you to get your heart rate up. I want you to be dancing at home or wherever you're at and burning calories. I want your hert to be beating faster. Ok? So we're gonna go to the right and to the left, ok? So your right foot's going which means you're actually going to the left, yeah? But don't think to much, more down here. Follow with me. Here we go. We have quick feet, quick feet, quick feet, quick feet. Side step, one, two and ba, ba da ba. Good. One, two. One, two. Quick feet, quick feet. Use those arms. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Good.

Now, I'm going to show you what an axel turn looks like. Starting in fondu tendu, and chaines, axel. Let me break that down for you. Starting in fondu tondu, first position, tendu devant, fondu or melt, the left supporting leg. Chaines in parallel position. You start with a tombe. Nice big lunge. Then left leg goes into parallel. The right leg extends devant, a la seconde into parallel passe. At the same time, you'll be tucking and jumping the supporting leg and extending the arm out, up to third and down. Let's try that a little bit slower. And down, down, up, down. You then step out of the axel. So, you're going to land in a nice fondu position. Left leg is bent and then you're going to step out with a tendu derriere. It is important to teach your students both the right side and the left side, so that the body is equally balanced. And left. A great exercise to teach children is if you place your hands on the bar and you go front, side, in and tuck. Front, side, in and tuck. You make them do that in a consecutive manner and that strengthens the supporting leg. Also, always think about your center, lifting up, up, up. And the arms listing up as well. A lot of times people do this and we don't want that. We want a nice extended line and long necks. And that's the axel turn.",kids dance learning,true

About Nicholeen Peck
========================
Despite your best efforts at raising children, is your family dysfunctional? Do your children set the rules and have control of your home instead of you? Are you looking for parenting skills that will help you create a united, happy family?

What's up, fellow B-boys and B-girls? My name is Kid Glyde. And I'm here to instruct you guys on breaking moves. Beginner, intermediate, and advanced, teaching you combos and all that. 

But I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I've been breaking for 17 years, still travelling the world, my goal is to teach kids around the world whether they have nothing or they have something. I want to go around the world and share my knowledge with the young talent out there and the ones that don't even know they have talent, you know? 

I come from a crew called Dynamic Rockers, I'm the leader now, my father passed down the torch to me, and the crew's been around since 1979. 1979. 

So with all that knowledge we decided to create Dynamic Rockers Academy, sharing the knowledge that we have, that we've been passed down, generation after generation and with the new guys that we have in our crew, their knowledge as well. You know, because it's not about just one crew, hey well all have something to share and our crew has a lot to share. dynamicrockersacademy.com, check that out. We will have our own tutorial up of workouts and basic moves. 

Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, like our page. We have our own page, Dynamic Rockers, I have my own page Kid Glyde, with a Y, don't forget it. Rep your style, check this out on our fan page, so stay up on DynamicRockersAcademy.com, repyourstyle.com, check us out on YouTube, Google us, you'll find mad information that will help you to learn stuff about the past because you got to know where you come from, you want to get into this culture, hey, why not learn about the culture?

Now I'd like to show you what a sashay looks like. Sashays are great to prep for leaps, and it's a great way to teach children how to plie into the floor, and use the floor and your feet as a traveling step.

Here's how to break it down. Let me show you what it looks like. Arms out, or you can have your arms up, or arms front. There are many deviations of the port de bra.

Let's do arms out first. Sashay. Sashay means to chase, so one leg is chasing the other across the floor. So you slide one out, then chase it. Slide one out, then chase it. Make sure your feet are pointed as well. Let me show you with the arms like this. Plie nice fourth position, then you jump up in fifth position, land and slide the right leg out.  

It's very important to teach using positions in a sashay. I see a lot of turned in sashays, and that's not going to help their leaps. You want to try to have everything placed and turned out using fifth, using fourth, using fifth, and then fifth, and then sliding out into the fourth position again.  

All right, here's a sashay, slowly first, and then I'll do it full out fast.  Sashay. Other side. Now a little bit faster. I'll do a different arm this time.  And, that is a sashay.",kids dance learning,true

Of course, this is NOT an exhaustive list of all african dances.

For those who ask : Ndombolo was done but had to be cut out during editing because of some filming issues.

ABOUT THE MOVIE
-------------------------------------
Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped ‚Äì and no one knows why.

From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes ‚ÄúMoana,‚Äù a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auli‚Äôi Cravalho) meets the once-mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she‚Äôs always sought: her own identity. Directed by the renowned filmmaking team of Ron Clements and John Musker (‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid,‚Äù ‚ÄúAladdin,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Princess & the Frog‚Äù) and produced by Osnat Shurer (‚ÄúLifted,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Man Band‚Äù), ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù sails into U.S. theaters on Nov. 23, 2016.


The Moana soundtrack is available now:

In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.
Petersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.
Strangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).
One night, Toomai's father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai's father is killed. Kala Nag's grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.
Petersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job. When Rham Lahl beats the elephant, however, Kala Nag injures his tormenter. The mahout insists that Kala Nag be destroyed, as is the law. Petersen manages to get him to change his mind and accept 100 rupees instead by threatening to have him removed from the safety of the camp.
Unaware of this reprieve, Toomai takes Kala Nag and runs away into the jungle. There, they stumble upon the missing wild elephants, and Toomai sees them dancing. He leads Petersen to them. The other natives are awed, and hail him as ""Toomai of the Elephants"". Machua Appa offers to train the boy to become a hunter, a plan Petersen approves.

All of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don‚Äôt realize that they‚Äôre learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom.

Our unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you‚Äôre sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.

Former ballet student, Tara Webster, was destined to become one of the top dancers of her generation before a devastating injury crippled her career. Over the last eighteen months she has tried to move on and embrace life as a university student but cannot get over her dream of dancing professionally. Haunted by her past, by the night she was injured, Tara embarks on a near impossible comeback, leaving her life and love behind in Sydney, determined to prove to the ballet world (not to mention herself) she still has what it takes.
As the rejections pile up, and Tara tears herself apart trying to fit the unrelenting ballet mould, she must start to find, and trust, her own voice before she loses everything that truly matters. This journey will take Tara far from home, reuniting with her Academy friends, ex-loves and former enemies, all still chasing their dreams after graduation in their own ways. But from New York to Texas and then finally onto the world stage, it‚Äôs only when Tara finally achieves everything she ever wanted she discovers where she truly belongs ‚Äì somewhere she never would‚Äôve expected.

PREGNANCY is often considered a time for women to put their feet up and take it easy. But hip-hop dance teacher, Christina Litle, is continuing to teach her vigorous body-popping routines ‚Äì despite being seven months pregnant. Christina ‚Äì who is now 35 weeks gone¬†‚Äì¬†has been criticised by strangers online, who have suggested her baby will be born disabled because of her energetic hobby. But despite a lack of medical assurance, the 28-year-old insists she isn‚Äôt putting the baby at risk and says there is a ‚Äòstigma‚Äô around pregnant women and now she has encouraged other mums-to-be to stay active by teaching a hip hop dance class to other pregnant women.

Hey STEEZY Nation,

It‚Äôs happening: you‚Äôre learning a new piece of choreography and all of a sudden, boom. Your brain gives up on you. Nothing is sticking! We‚Äôve all been there‚Ä¶so here‚Äôs some help.

Clay and Jessie share 3 simple tips to help kick your brain into gear and remember those moves. üß†

Try these:

1. Name moves and make correlating sounds.
2. Snap at end points.
3. Breathe during pauses, holds, and grooves.

Bonus Tip: Try writing down the choreography ‚Äî like naming the dance moves, but just on paper!

Adding cues to create a personal connection to the choreography (through naming the moves, sounds, snaps, and breathing) will prompt your brain to register the dance moves better.

Comment below to share more tips with your fellow STEEZY Nation peeps!

Like and subscribe to our channel for more STEEZY.

Thanks for watching and hope you enjoyed the video!

With Love,

STEEZY Squad

Loretta:  Hey, everybody. What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance to house music. The basic thing when we're dancing to house is really just be in the moment, and love it and just be in it, and just really be free. 

Anthony:  So house music has a bunch of different varieties. You have the different beats, you have the different sounds, and you have the different rhythms. But if you keep on the rhythm and keep the bounce in your feet and always be free and let it come to you, you'll be fine dancing to house music.

Now the step I'm going to teach you guys today is the cross hit. We're going to do it slow. We're going to jump and hit, and we're going to cross our feet. Left foot coming forward, right foot going back to start. Ready? Cross and hit, now you're going to switch feet. You're right foot is going to come forward and you're left is going to go back. Ready? Cross hit, and we're going to do that four times, really slow. 

Ready? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit. Now if you want to speed it up, you can. If you want to stay at this pace, you're more than welcome to. So we're going to stay at this pace, and just do it eight times really quick, so you guys can see the basics. 

Right foot is going to go behind first, left foot is going to go forward and we're going to cross and hit. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, cross hit, and cross hit. So since we just taught you the steps about the cross hit, I'm going to teach you about the arms. 

It's the same kind of thing. When we cross, right foot going back, left going forward, we're going to cross our arms and then open them out. Cross them again and open them out. So this when you pair them together, gives you more of like a rhythm and a feel, and it really gets you loose,  instead of just doing this the whole time. You kind of almost look like an Irish dancer. But if you have some flow into it and you're really able to pop, you'll be able to make it a lot more efficient, and a lot more people looking at you.

Loretta:  Absolutely.
 
Anthony:  So we're going to do this four times; five six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; and  that's how you dance to house music.",kids dance learning,true

Loretta:  Hey, everybody, what's happening?  My name's Loretta and this is Ava.  We're the Double Time Twins and today we're going to teach you how to dance when you're at the club and the deejay is mixing.  Usually there's maybe five, maybe ten seconds depending on where you are when the deejay is scratching, when you're not really sure what kind of songs are going to come on next.

Ava:  And if you're with your friends in a group, it could be an awkward five or ten seconds.  Everyone's standing in a circle like . . .

Both:  . . . ""cool, wonder what they're going to play next.  I wonder what's going on.  What's going on?  I don't know, I don't know.""  

Ava:  And then the song kicks in and you're like, ""oh my God, that's my song.""  

Loretta:  So, basically, two things to remember is to just keep moving, keep dancing and while that awkward five or ten seconds is going on, you can never go wrong with a step-touch.  So that's what we're going to show you how to do today.  So, basically, start out with your feet shoulder width apart.  And take your right foot and go step, together, step, together, step, together, step, together.  And that's it.  That's what you could do when the deejay stops.

Ava:  You can even add a snap if you want, or a head, snake it out, go down and up.

Loretta:  You can pretty much do whatever you want with this move. You can put your arms up, bring them down, anything you want.  Just remember two things during that five or ten seconds while the deejay is mixing, keep moving, keep dancing, keep the party going.  And that's how you dance when the deejay is mixing.",kids dance learning,true

Dance lessons for the club!

Entire Playlist:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhBM3T68vyiGknKGPbOOXki

Hi ladies, I'm Leshana, and today I'm going to tell you how to dance in a club. Have you ever gone out to a club at night, and your favorite song is on, and you have no idea what to do? Well, with this simple formula I'm going to help you with some dance moves that will get you through your favorite song. 

So I like to call it the Head to Toe. So you start with your head, and then you work all the way down to your feet. Incorporating some really simple dance moves. So you can start with a hair flip, and a shoulder move, and then hips, and then a step touch. Really simple. It looks like you're the best dancer ever, because you're grooving to the beat. But you're just doing four simple steps. Again, that's a hair toss, then a shoulder move, then a hip roll, and then a step together. Okay?

We can put that all together, and repeat it over and over again, with some variations. And it looks like you're doing an amazing dance, but you're just moving from your head, your shoulders, your hips, to your feet. Okay? Let's try it all together. So head. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. Again. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. One more time. Hair. Shoulders. Hips. Step touch. That's the Head to Toe that you can do in the club to your favorite song.",kids dance learning,true

What's up? My name is Matt Steffanina, and I'm going to show you how to dance like Michael Jackson. 

Now, Michael Jackson is famous for a lot of different dance moves but we're going to take his biggest move today, and I'm going to break it down for you step by step, and that's the moonwalk. 

Now, it's important to note that Michael did not invent the moonwalk, he actually was taught the moonwalk, but he did make it famous. 

You should also know that the moonwalk is a different move and the move that Michael made famous was called the backslide.

The moonwalk is the same glide, but in a circle, whereas the backslide is done in a straight line, the way Michael did it. Let's break it down step by step. 

The first thing we're going to do is take our back foot, lift the heel up, and press the ball of our foot into the ground. The left foot, or the front foot, is going to slide back across the floor. Now, when you slide your foot, you always want to keep it flat. This goes for almost every glide.

The illusion is created when it looks like a flat foot is sliding across the ground. For instance, if I bring my heel up and slide my foot on the toe, I lose the illusion. You want to make sure that that heel is in contact with the floor as you're sliding back. 

From here, you're just going to switch your feet, bringing up the heel of the left foot and pressing down the heel of the right foot. Slide the right foot back. Switch your feet again.

You're going to repeat this process as many times as you want to get your backslide going across the floor. 

A couple things that will help you. Michael was really good at switching his legs really quickly and really strongly. A lot of times when you see people moonwalk, it's very lazy whereas Michael's was very clean and very snappy. So, each time you switch your feet, you want to think of pressing your heel into the floor, and lifting your other heel as quickly as possible. It also helps to get higher up on your toe, so really lift that heel of the supporting foot.

Let's try and do a few of them in a row and start to practice travelling across the floor while doing the backslide. 

So, we want to start up on our right toe, we're going to slide our left foot back, and we're going to connect four slides to glide all the way across the floor. And that's how you dance like Michael Jackson.",kids dance learning,false

Children are invited to take part in each conversation by submitting videos of themselves to be featured in the episode.

Poppy & Posie Blossom are the beloved main characters of the award-winning picture book, ""The Blossom Shoppe,"" which was published under The Blossom Company -- the children‚Äôs book publishing and media company where stories truly come off the page through storybook character videos and live events as well as through fun and enriching book-inspired products to promote creativity and a love of reading.

Through the unique combination of literature and storybook character videos for kids and events along with book-inspired products and activities (crafts, coloring pages, DIY kits, music albums, costumes, and more), The Blossom Company hopes to inspire children to become active and passionate readers, to encourage children to connect what they read to the world around them, and last but not least, to make sure that each and every child knows exactly how BLOSSOM they are!

Driven by a love of creating enriching and inspiring content for children, The Blossom Company was co-founded by Caroline & Katherine Brickley, 22-year-old twin sisters, during their freshman year of college. Caroline & Katherine perform as Poppy and Posie in their internationally-acclaimed YouTube show and they are so happy and humbled to be a part of the kind and welcoming worldwide community the show has fostered.

The Blossom Company is dedicated to and inspired by its mission statement:

25,P-Wm3SgweHc,Children learn ballroom dance from Champ,"Ballroom,dance,dancing,children,music,dancer","Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Estonian and Italian can be heard spoken as mothers of these heritages prepare their 5, 6 and 7 year olds for a ballroom dancing class at the Water Tower Recreation Center.  Victoria Scotti brings 5 year old Isabella, who also takes ballet, both for the music and the chance to dance with boys.  Instructor Alina Fiorella, a teacher of 17 years,  says she stopped professional competition in ballroom dancing which led her to two Ukrainian national championships when she started a family. But she began instructing young children when she was a teen in the Ukraine and continues to do so, now bringing her class to Chestnut Hill.

Fiorella listens solicitously as one child asks for more snacks and another complains of a sore arm. After addressing their concerns, she firmly directs her students through the hour lesson in both dance etiquette and a variety of dance, along with music or with voice commands alone. 

Of the  promenades, polkas and such, the ""Box dance"" is 7 year old Emma Barton's favorite. Late in the lesson they heel-toe-heel-toe, ""Shuffle off to Buffalo and then come back to Mexico."" And then their tired selves are taken up in their mothers' arms.",kids dance learning,false

Descendants 2

W.I.C.K.E.D news, the Villain Kids are BACK! 

As Mal, Evie, Carlos and Jay try to settle into their new life in Auradon, some are finding it more difficult to fit in that others. The pressures of royalty have got to Mal so much that the only way she feels she can be happy is to ditch heart-throb BF Ben and go back to being rotten on the Isle of the Lost. However, things have changed A LOT on the Isle the worst being that her arch nemesis Uma (daughter of Ursula üêô) has taken over her turf! Let‚Äôs just say Uma has not forgotten all the wicked things Mal did before she left for Auradon and with the help of the Harry (Captain Hook‚Äôs son ) and Gil (Gaston‚Äôs son) she is plotting payback! 

This action-packed tale is not without more brand-new songs from the VK‚Äôs like ‚ÄòWays to be Wicked‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs My Name‚Äô and ‚ÄòChillin‚Äô like a Villain‚Äô. Not to mention their awesome covers of ‚ÄòKiss the Girl‚Äô and ‚ÄòPoor unfortunate Souls‚Äô from Disney‚Äôs classic ‚ÄòThe Little Mermaid‚Äô. 

Who‚Äôs who? 

Mal (Dove Cameron) is the daughter of Maleficent, but this villain kid has traded in her wicked ways on the Isle of the Lost to become King Ben‚Äôs GF and Auradon‚Äôs most popular ‚ÄòLady of the Court‚Äô. However, Ben‚Äôs magic ban has made living in the kingdom hard and Mal can‚Äôt help but use her little book of spells for even the simplest of things. 

Evie (Sofia Carson) may be the daughter of the Evil Queen however, she is nothing like her. Her kind and smart nature, paired with a wicked fashion sense means she is not your typical villain kid. Evie has dreamed of living in Auradon her whole life, but the idea of doing it without her bestie, Mal is not an option and they sing it out in their awesome duet ‚ÄòRather Be with You‚Äô. The pair are absolute bestfriend goals!

Carlos (Cameron Boyce) is the tech whiz-kid of the crew and his new life in Auradon has meant he is free of the grasps of his evil mother Cruella de Vil. Not only this, but thanks to King Ben he has outgrown his fear of dogs created by Cruella and now couldn‚Äôt live without his canine side-kick Dude! 

Jay (Booboo Stewart) is also back to join his VK pals! Jafar‚Äôs son has well and truly left his thieving ways back on the Isle and now saves his impressive skills for Auradon High‚Äôs sports teams only. Jay is actually so awesome that he was crowned captain of the Auradon Swords and Shields Team‚Ä¶ haha, beat that Chad Charming! 

Uma (China Anne McClain) is the daughter of Ursula, new queen of the run-down town and not to mention Mal‚Äôs life-long archenemy! Uma certainly isn‚Äôt one to let things go, she is still bitter that she wasn‚Äôt chosen by King Ben to live in Auradon and is on a mission of revenge! She‚Äôs pretty fierce and you certainly won‚Äôt forget her name after the film is over. Whats my name? UMA! 

King Ben (Mitchell Hope) As Ben becomes the King of Auradon he tries to change the kingdom for the better. His first royal decree is to reverse his parents‚Äô (Queen Belle and King Adam) law of keeping all children of the Isle on there, he believes they should get a chance of redemption. Much like his mother did with the Beast, Ben sees behind Mal‚Äôs rottenness and they fall in love *Aww* ‚ù§. 

Harry (Thomas Doherty form The Lodge) is Uma‚Äôs first mate in the pirate gang, pretty fitting seeing as he is Captain Hook‚Äôs son!",kids dance learning,false

Get a little hula in your life by learning how to do these basic moves.

Step 1: 
Stand facing your mirror with your feet about four inches apart. Bend your knees and put your hands on your hips. 

Tip
Dance on a comfortable surface; the hula is always done barefoot.

Step 2: 
Use this four-beat pattern for your feet. First, step eight inches to the right with your right foot. Second, bring your left foot toward your right without sliding it. Third, step with your right foot again, and fourth, bring your left foot toward your right, tapping the ground on the fourth beat. Switch directions, leading with the left foot. 

Step 3: 
Now bring your hips into the four-beat mix. As you step to the right, lower your foot toe-heel and lift your hip; repeat with your left foot and hip. Sway right, then left, right again, and then left again. Repeat to the left side. 

Tip
Keep your knees bent ‚Äì it helps your hips sway!

Step 4: 
Bend your left arm so your hand is in front of the left side of your chest, palm facing down, fingers together and gently extended. Extend your right arm away from your body at shoulder level and keep your elbow slightly bent, your palm down, and your fingers together.

Step 5: 
Without letting your left arm touch your chest, bend your elbows and wrists so they are swaying in a wave motion. On the first step to the left, switch so the left arm is extended and the right arm is in front of your right breast. Repeat.

Tip
As you move, keep your body relaxed but your shoulders still. 

Step 6: 
Look out at your extended hand while you're dancing. If mele, or traditional song, accompanies your dance, use your face and eyes to tell the story of the song. And don‚Äôt forget to smile! Hula dancing is for celebrations.

Did You Know?
19th-century Christian missionaries urged Hawaiian women to replace the hula skirt with a high-necked, long-sleeved gown called a holoku.",kids dance learning,true

My name is Maegan Woodin, and I'm  a professional dancer, choreographer, teacher and student. I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. The five basic positions of ballet are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th. 
So first position is when your toes are apart and your heels are squeezed directly together. A lot of people try to turn out the toes too much, and this creates stress in the knees, so follow your natural turnout line, and stand fully supported, very tall, making sure you're not rolling onto the inside of your foot, or rolling to the outside. Make sure that your feet and your weight are directly over and centered onto your toes. And then your arms are going to be like a round beach ball, and you should have your arms directly in front of your belly button not too high and not too low so directly in front of your belly button, your chest is open and your shoulders are down and you are engaging your back, and you stand in first position. 

Second position, your arms and legs are out to the side, and you actually want to gauge the length of your second position by putting one toe next to your heel, then opening it up, and then extending it a little further. you shouldn't have too wide a second position, or too narrow, because you wont be fully supported when you're moving around in that position. Second position arms are rounded and slightly forward, you dont want to throw your arms too far back, so keep them nice, round, and forward, and that's second position.

Third position is used on a very basic level. It is when you are practicing to get to fifth position. You want to put your heel in the centre of your foot, and stand with both feet firmly on the ground, feet turned out. Your arms are going to come one high above your head and one directly to the side. Make sure that both arms are rounded and that your chest is lifted and your neck is long.
 
Fourth position, your leg comes out, and your heel is going to try to become in front of that toe, and your arm is going to be coming in front of your belly button. We want to make sure that your fourth position is not too wide, just like second position, and not too narrow. You want to have a pretty narrow fourth position, which will help you when you do turns in the centre.
Fifth position, both arms are up very high, and your chest is open, shoulders down, and your feet and heels are going to be connected. You don't want to try to squeeze your turnout and make both feet and heels connected fully, you want to follow the natural line of your turnout, and make sure that when you pliet, your knees are going directly over your toes. 

So standing in fifth position, your arms are going to go all the way up, like this, and thats high fifth, and then low fifth, your arms are down here.",kids dance learning,true

""Hi, my name is Robert Royston.  I'm a five time world champion of country dance, working with artists like Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley.  I really hope that you learn how to line dance and experience what it's like to move to America's music, and that's country music.
So, one of the dances that you must learn, and it's really called round dancing, what we're doing, what we're about to do, because it goes in a circle but it's a set piece of choreography, a lot like line dancing.  But, no matter where you go in the United States, if you're going to a place that does line dancing, they're probably going to do the Cotton Eyed Joe.  The Cotton Eyed Joe is a dance that you can do with a partner, you could have somebody alongside you, or you can do it by yourself, or you can do it in rows of people.  Sometimes you'll have rows of eight or nine people, all shoulders around each other, doing the Cotton Eyed Joe.  
Cotton Eyed Joe has two variations that I'll show you.  One is stomp, just a stomp stomp.  Kick the same foot back up with the triple step, triple step.  Then, same thing with the other foot.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Yeah, so that goes one, two, a three and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  One, two, a three and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  
The variation, depending on the region you are in, to that, is that instead of a stomp, they do a touch.  They go touch across, touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  So depending on the variations so you can see that in the front, I'll either cross my foot over, then kick, then back up.  Cross, kick, triple step.  Cross, kick, triple step.  Or, I'll stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  
I tend to like to make a lot of noise so I do the stomp.  
Then what you're going to do after the final triple, you're going to do eight counts of a shuffle, which we've learned in another series here in the line dance series, is a shuffle step, shuffle step, shuffle step, shuffle step.  You're going to do eight counts of that.  So you're going to go one and two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight and it starts over.  One, two, a three, and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  One, two, a three, and four.  Five, six, and then you shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle and start it over.  
And again, lines of people.  The more people in there the more fun it is.  Or, you can do it by yourself, cruise around the floor, see other people in a line, hook on up and do the Cotton Eyed Joe.
We're going to do this to music right now.  
Five, six, five, six, seven go.  One, two, triple step.  Triple step, stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick and here we go.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.
Stomp, kick, triple step. Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.   Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, and stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.   Stomp, kick, triple step.  Shuffle, shuffle.  I'll do the other variation.   Touch, triple step, touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  And shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  And it repeats itself.
And there you have the Cotton Eyed Joe.

The best way to learn any dance is to practice the elements that make up that dance, much like practicing your scales on a piano. If you learn to read music and you learn your scales, you can play any song put in front of you. Same type of thing when it comes to the different styles of swing. If you understand some basic swing elements you can put them together a lot like Legos to make up the different style of swing. Some of those elements are walking, touch-stepping, triple stepping, and kick-ball-changes. Let's just do that in place. 

Just walk in place. Doesn't matter what foot you start with, just walk. Feel what that walking rhythm feels like. Now we want to make sure we're over our feet, not back here marching behind our feet, right? We're dancing over our feet, right? So there's walking. 

Then there's touch-stepping. Touch, step, touch, step. When get comfortable touch-stepping don't just do it underneath you. Touch to the side, touch forward and back. Get comfortable just moving around. 

And then of course we have our triple steps as well. Triple step underneath you, right? Triple step going sideways. I would even triple step going forward and back. Right? Just getting comfortable with what that rhythm feels like. 

Then we have our kick-ball-change. Kick, ball (it's the ball of the foot), change. From the side that goes kick, ball change, kick, ball change. You can even do it with both feet. Kick, ball change, kick, ball change. Again, kick, ball change, kick, ball change. 

If you don't pick the foot up it's touch-ball-change. Touch, ball change, touch, ball change, as opposed to a kick-ball-change. Some movement, just looks a little bit different because I'm not picking the foot up. So we're going to go ahead and take those elements and put them to music. You want to practice them a lot so that you can draw upon them as necessary when you're doing the different varieties of swing. We're going to do it to music right now.

There you have all of your elements that make up swing dancing.",kids dance learning,true

Best Daredevil Day Ever 1155

One of the families favorite things about October is all of the Halloween decorations. Jenny, Adley and Niko Bear found some awesome bats that go perfect for the holiday and decide to hang them on the door. Adley, being the loving little girl that she is, groups them in families and names them after all of us. 

Once the door is all decorated, the find me downstairs so they can show me the great job that they did. After decorations, Adley comes up with a brand new game called statue! the rules are easy, Adley and Niko are statues, Jenny sells them, and I buy them. But they are crazy. The Adley statue moves around when I'm not looking while the Niko Bear statue has a button to make it come a live and run around the room. haha I love pretend play with the kiddos!!

With the new game done, I have to show you guys a new trick that the kiddos and I learned. We can hang from the ceiling in the kitchen!! It's hilarious, though Jenny wishes we didn't use the house like a park toy. We then head to the backyard splash pad to find some rocks for arts and crafts time.

We love doing little DIY creative projects with the kiddos, but these are extra special, because we are going to take these rocks to the construction site of a brand new LDS Temple. These temples are super important to us, so its awesome that we get to put little memories into the foundation. Adley draws pretty flowers, Niko colors his rock so good, and Jenny makes a cute rock for her and baby Navey and I make a rock about our family and how much we love each other. ( Also with a little pirate theme for pirate island lol)

After dropping of the rocks and doing some work at the lake lot, I'm home for the night! I also brought gifts for the whole family. We have A for Adley shirts again!! We have a brand new company making them and they look so good. The colors are bright, the images look great, and we are excited to share them with you guys again!! Prices are still the same, we want them to be easy for you to get. If you bought a shirt before and there were problems with it, we want to help. After unboxing the surprise, it's time to start our bed time routine and end this amazing Best Day Ever!!

Children will learn the moves to this fun doo wop dance song! This action, dance is great for brain breaks, indoor recess and group activities!

Doo Wop Dancing Voices is a great action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into actions and movements that allow them to:
‚Ä¢ refresh
‚Ä¢ recharge
‚Ä¢ refocus
‚Ä¢ regenerate
‚Ä¢ release stress
‚Ä¢ breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increases circulation and promotes physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also ideal for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Doo Wop Dancing Voices
From the CD, You Can Dance!
by The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
Doo Wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music popular in the mid-1950's and early 60's. This style contains harmonizing vocals using nonsense syllables. Have a seat, feel the beat and follow the directions to this cool, vocal dancing song that concludes with a fun hand-jive.

Repeated refrain throughout:
Doo wop doo wop a rub a dub a doo wop a wop a ram a lam doo wop a wop scoobby doo doo
Ding a ling a ling a ling a linga loo Babba ran a bada bing.
Verse:
We're gonna bounce to the Doo Wop Dancing beat.
We're gonna sing and harmonize our voices right from our seat.
We're gonna clap to the rhythm and move to the sound,
To the doo wop dancing voices all around.
Sing whoop whoop - whoop whoop
Sing a woe we wo wo - a woe we wo wo
Sing dum ditty dum - dum ditty dum
Sing shoop shoop - shoop shoop

Shimmy your shoulders to the Doo Wop beat.
This is a dance we're gonna do right from our seat.
You gotta feel the rhythm and tap with your feet.
Doo Wop Dancing Voices harmonizing is neat.
Sing...
sha sha - sha sha
Sing na na na na - na na na na
Sing aah aah - aah aah
Sing la la la la - la la la la Repeat Verse
Sing oh oh oh - oh oh oh
Sing go go go - go go go
Sing ooh ooh ooh - ooh ooh ooh
Sing ga ga goo - ga ga goo

Elvis: Hello, everybody, it's Elvis.
I want you all to follow me with some Doo Wop moves right from your seat...
(Now), Roll your hands to the left, (now) roll (your hands) (them) to the right...
Everybody tap your knees, (oh, baby) (you're out of sight)
(Now), Tap your fists together.
(Now) Cross your hands above. (Now) Switch and cross them below.
(Now) Tap your right elbow, (and then) (Now tap) your left (elbow) then
All we can do is start all over again...
(Repeat this section 2X)
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.

| Q&A | 

Q: How old are you?
A: 19 years old from the 16th of February.

Q: How do I get a Crownboards?
A: They aren't sold at the moment, due to internal work at Crownboards. Mainly so the Crown Boss can finish his school and we can start with a perfectly working online shop around april 2017. Stay tuned!!

Q: What editing program do you use?
A: Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and sometimes After Effects for some extra's.

Q: What camera do you use?
A: A Canon 60D with 18-85mm lens (sometimes 50mm) and a Canon Legria HF G10.

Q: How long have you been longboarding?
A: I think I started in 2012, you can do the math ;)

Q: How long does it take to edit the videos?
A: When I started this channel, it took me about 8 hours for an 8min video. Now I can proudly say that I've probably cut it to about 6 or something. Still a lot though but when you count in searching for music, creating the description and other upload info,... It's quite understandable haha.

Q: How much does the Royal Tribe cost? 
A: The board costs 199 euros without shipping.

Q: Does Crownboards ship to ""...""? 
A: Crownboards ships to almost every country, but the price will increase with more distance. Europe has pretty cheap shipping prices, you should contact Crownboards for more info about other countries.

Q: What longboard should I buy?
A: Check out my Ultimate Guide For Buying A Longboard video. Everything I know is in that video :)
https://youtu.be/qSH0UH6agUc

Q: I'm starting longboarding, got some tips?
A: For sure! I'm trying to make as much informative videos as possible so we can grow together. Here's a playlist for you:

Children dance to an integrated curriculum of vocabulary, phonics, compound words and words‚Äîall while having a blast and appearing on your TV screen!

Children will love to dance, sing and see themselves on the TV screen. Walk, wiggle, shake and shimmy to action verbs. Swing both arms and punch the Compound Word Dance Machine button to make compound words. Beat on the drum to complete Doodleburg rhymes. Dance to percussive beats between rhymes. Soar, spin, shake, reach and run to mimic the pterodactyl‚Äôs actions. Dance like feathers in the breeze to see a flying feather pattern on screen, twirl and shake for more fun visuals. Reach up and smack fruits‚Äîbig and small, green and purple, striped and bumpy‚Äîbased on the adjectives. The camera puts children on center stage where their body motion controls the gameplay. 

Dance and Learn combines dancing and singing with seamlessly embedded early literacy curriculum for a truly joyful and invigorating reading rumpus. Play the games in a random sequence, select specific games or customize a set of dances for an educational and dynamic dance party! Children can play with family or friends in multiplayer mode or keep the spotlight for solo dancing. Whichever way they play, it‚Äôs sure to spell active fun! (Multiplayer feature requires a single controller.)

LeapFrog creates award-winning educational solutions that delight, engage and inspire children to reach their potential. We know that children learn best when they‚Äôre having fun, and that every child learns differently. With solutions that are personalized to each child‚Äôs level, every day brings pure learning fun.

Albuquerque Turkey - by The Learning Station
From Children's Favorites Autumn Songs & Fingerplays
¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station (Musical Arrangement)

Albuquerque is a turkey
And he's feathered and he's fine
And he wobbles and he gobbles
And he's absolutely mine.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
And he wobbles and he gobbles,
And he's absolutely mine.

He's the best pet that you can get...
Better than a dog or cat.
He's my Albuquerque turkey
And I'm awfully proud of that.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
He's my Albuquerque turkey,
and I'm awfully proud of that.
He once told me, very frankly
He preferred to be my pet,
Not the main course at my dinner,
And I told him not to fret.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
Not the main course at my dinner,                                                                        And I told him not to fret.

Now my Albuquerque turkey
Is so happy in his bed,
'Cause for our Thanksgiving dinner...
We had mac and cheese instead.

Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble get.
'Cause for our Thanksgiving dinner,
We had mac and cheese instead.
We had mac and cheese instead.                                                                        We had mac and cheese instead.

All right, you guys, what is going on? This is ""Billy Jean.‚Äù The intro, the very beginning, he starts this pose here. What you're going to is you're going to step in with your right, and then come here with your left. He does this pose in most of his music videos, but he uses this as the intro for this song. You're going to have a hat, too. Very important, get a hat. As long as you have a hat and shirt or a jacket that kind of flips over, you're good to go.

Now, you have here. Make sure when you put the hat on, the fingers are spread so you have this, and then you're going to ping, put it down like you're getting ready, razzle dazzle. You're going to go one, two, three, and a four, five, six, seven, eight, and a two, two, three, four, five, six, and a seven, and an eight.

Okay. Now, the next part of the intro. Prep your jump, now you're going to kick. You're going to go kick and you're going to tap that knee, so it's like bah. That's what creates the electricity in that kick. You got to tap it and pose it. Pah, roll, shoot out, bow, and then you're going to pelvic thrust, look.

You're going to repeat the same thing. Step, kick, bow, roll, shoot out, sit, and make sure your hands are stylized right up in here. Shoot, look, cross, bow, jazz hands, boom.

You're going to come out here, shwoop, ha. When you hear boom, the right is going to go behind the left or vice versa. However you want to learn it, your choice. Then switch, shwoop, mm-hm, grab your hat, shoo, and then flick it. So, you have, hold this for four at one, tick tick, two, tick tick, three tick tick, four, and a one, two, three, four, five, six, and a seven, and an eight, and two, two, three, four, five, and a six, and a seven, eight, prep, kick, roll, shoot, bow, hit. Prep, kick, roll, shoot, thrust. Look, swhoo, ha. Throw it. Take it off first, shwoo.

And then, he gets ready. He smooths his hair. At the time, he had a nice little jerry curl going on, so he swooped it, ha, and then smoothed it again, shoo, ta, shwoom, step, and then, that's when he gets his microphone, shoo, and he starts singing.",kids dance learning,true

Hi, my name is Vick the Show...

And I'm LaShawna.

And today we're going to teach you an exotic style of dance. This exotic dance that we're going to teach you is...from West Africa. It's called azonto, yeah? So, it's a simple, groovy step, where we're going to stay grounded in it. K? And basically, you want to have your legs going like this motion, right here. And in that, you'll find pockets where you can thrust, and do that.

But the thrusting, trust me, it will come with the movement entirely. So the next thing I'm going to teach you, aside from the leg movement, is your hands. Your hands simply, you want to go here, here, here, here. Here, here, here, here. Now you can do it two ways. You can have your hands straight, you can have your hands a little bit more free and open. It's totally up to you. Cool?

So we are going to lean to the left, open our legs, bring our legs in. Lean to the right, bring our legs in. Bring them to the left, in, then left again. And then we're going to do the same thing over here. Right, in, left, in, right, in, right.

And that's pretty much a basic understanding of how to do azonto-style dance. Yeah? So, me and LaShawna, is going to do a demonstration for you. K?

5, 6, 7, go, and a ah, ah, ah, ah. And a ah, ah, and a ah, ah. And then once you get into the groove of it, you can do your own style. Yeah? 

And that is azonto-style dance. Yeah?",kids dance learning,true

I've got two big ears I can flip-flop

Twisting hips that move to the beat
Everybody do the Easter Bunny dance and freeze

Springtime, lot's of birds and bees

All right. What's going on y'all? So, we're about to do Beat It right now. This is probably one of your all time favorites of Michael Jackson, as well as mine. I'm going to bring it to you, baby. So, we're going to start out. Right foot is going to step out, right arm is going to hit. One, two, hit, three, left leg, four, right leg, five, six, left leg, seven, eight. Now you're going to reach up with the right arm. One, reach with the left, two, reach with the right again. This time the right foot comes out, three, and four on the left side, left foot comes out this time. Left, right and a five as you're reaching, the waist is going to come on the outside. Pull, waist goes on the inside. Six, and a seven, eight, mm-hmm. 

Pretty much the pelvic thrust, which is one of Michael's all time favorite moves. So, from the top again. Start out with that left. We have five, six, seven, eight. Right foot steps on one, two, left foot, three, four, right foot, five, six, left foot seven, eight. Reach with the right arm, one, reach left, two, reach right, as well as the right foot, three.  Reach left, as well as the left foot, four, ball change, five, reach out, pelvic thrust, six. Reach out, seven, pull in on the eight. Second part, left, right. And, one as both arms come out. You're going to turn, two. You're going to repeat the same thing on this side and three. And you're going to turn, four. You're going to hit, five. Left shoulder moves, hit six. Right shoulder moves, hold seven. Swing eight. One swing, two, three sway it, four, five, six, seven, eight. Mm-hmm. That last part one more time.

I‚Äôm going to break down a couple of basic jazz dance terms for you. The first one is a pirouette. Here we go. You start with the preparation. Arms are in a nice L position, you step back with your right leg, ball, change, nice deep pli√© into the ground, you push off your back right foot into a pass√©, and arms go into a round first position and then drop down to neutral. I‚Äôll break that down one more time. Ball, change, up, and down. 

A great way to break this down for kids or even beginner adults is to go in the box. Ball, change, hold, and down. Face to side. Ball, change, hold, and down. Face the back, ball, change, hold, and down. Face the side, ball, change, hold, and down. Face the front. Then you break it down into a half turn. Ball, change, face the back, and down. Ball, change, face the front, and down. Important is that the pass√© leg is completely connected to the knee, okay. So that it‚Äôs pressed against, the core is activated, stomach is pressed down into the lower back and you‚Äôre also holding your arms in a nice round position, lifting up through the body. 

After the half turns then you should try for a full turn. If you step on your right and pick up your right leg you turn to the right, and ball, change, up, and down. One more time, ball, change, up, and down. That can then go into a double, triple, quadruple, or five, six, seven, eight turns as the students become more and more advanced with turning. Double, ball, change, up, up, down. You should really try to teach to clean it in a nice parallel position. 

We can also, and also you need to do that on the right and the left, which I‚Äôll show you with the music. Another basic jazz turn is an inward turn. Inward turns look like this. You start with a nice tombe, arms are prepared and then you pick up your left leg but turn towards your right, using your right arm. Up, and down. Again, the inward jazz turn is up, and down. Again, keep thinking about really pushing off that back leg into the pass√© right away. I‚Äôll show you to the left. Left arm opens, right arm closes, you push up into the pass√© and drop down. That‚Äôs the inward jazz turn. 

So there you are. Those are two very basic jazz turns that you can teach your students, inwards and outwards. Ball, change, pass√©, and down. Side, ball, change, up, and down. Face the back. Ball, change, up, and down. To the side. Ball, change, up, and down. To the front half turn, and to the front. Try to hold that releve as long as possible. Now singles. One more time. Go for a double. Good job. All right you need to reverse that to the left. I‚Äôm not going to do that right now, but you guys need to do that. So right and left are very, very important. 

All right here are the inward turns. Nice tombe, and use your arms pull it up. Up, and down. Good, one more time. Up and down. Other side I will do this time. Up and down. One more time. Up and down. Good. Really try to sustain those turns and lengthen up through your torso.",kids dance learning,true

Victor: Hi, my name is Victor Sho.

LaShonna: And I'm LaShonna.

Victor: And we are going to teach you some old school hip hop moves. So, now these are some moves that if you are going to some eighties party, you can bust out on the floor, or even if you're at any party, like if you're at a club, or a wedding reception, or at a friends party, a friends house party. You can just bust these old school moves when you hear some old school music. All right, so for the first step we're going to do we are going to put all the weight on our left leg, we're going to hike up our right leg, and then at the same time we're going to push forward our left elbow. Okay? And you're going to do it, one, two. And then you're going to do the same thing, but the opposite. So, you're going to put all of your weight on your right leg, lift up your left leg, and then push forward your right elbow, three, four. So, you're going to do double, double, double, double, single, single and double, double. That's how we're going to do it. On the beat, here we go. Five, six, five, six, seven, go, single, double, single, single. Yeah.

LaShonna: Awesome. The next step that we're going to do is an old school move called The Kid in Play. You can do it by yourself, but it's much better with a partner. So, Victor and I are going to show you The Kid in Play. All right, we're going to face the side, stepping first with our left foot, kick each other with the right, step back, do it again, step forward, and then we step back. This time, one, two, grab, three. Let's just do that much. Ready? Five, six, left foot step, left kick right, and then we step back, left kick right, and then we step back, left, one, two, grab, three. We're going to hop around four times. One, two, three, four, and that's The Kid in Play.

Victor: Are we going to do it together?

LaShonna: Sure.

Victor: Okay. Five, six, five, six, seven . . . Clap, one, two, three, four. All right, and that's The Kid in Play. So, the next move is going to be?

LaShonna: The Humpty Dance.

Victor: Oh! The Humpty Dance. All right. So, this one is super simple. All you're going to do is wave your hands. Your right hand is going this was. Your left hand goes this way. Your right hand goes this way. Your left hand goes this way, and you see, naturally your body is leaning there, right? So, all you have to do now is just bounce. So, you just bounce right here. This is The Humpty Dump Bounce. All right? So, what you want to do now is apply that same motion with your hands with this bounce. Five, six, seven, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and that's how you Humpty Hump. Yeah, old school Humpty Hump.

LaShonna: From the top?

Victor: Yeah.

Lashawna: Let's put all three together . . .

Victor: Yeah.

LaShonna: . . . and pretend that we're at an old school party. All right?

Victor: Yeah.

LaShonna: Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight.

Victor: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one . . . and that's how you do all three dances, right there.

LaShonna: Old school.

Victor: Old school moves.",kids dance learning,true

""Monkey in the Middle""
From the CD and DVD, ""Physical Ed""
¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station

The children form a circle and one child, (the monkey) goes to the middle and makes up a dance or movement for everyone else to imitate, then takes a bow and moves to the outside. All the children get a chance to be the monkey separately. At the end of the song all the children step in the middle to do all the new movements initiated by all the monkeys. 

Monkey see, monkey do. Do you want to follow monkey too? There's a monkey in the middle, just because you got to do what that little monkey does. Follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey. Chorus: Now the monkey in the middle takes a bow, there's a new little monkey gonna show us how. Monkey's in the middle, just because, you got to do what that little monkey does. Follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey. Repeat chorus (3x) Monkey see, monkey do. Step in the middle, be a monkey too. We're all monkeys in the middle, just because we can do anything any monkey does. Follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey, follow monkey.

 Like to dance, like to dance
 To the rhythm of your heart
 Every time they have a chance

Tilt your head from side to side
Let the music be your guide
Or bob it up and down instead 
It's a dance of your head

Lift your arms to the sky
Wave in circles, try to fly
Like the windmills on the farms
It's a dance of your arms

 Every single body part
 Like to dance, like to dance
 To the rhythm of your heart
 Every time they have a chance

Snap your fingers when you swing
Clap your hands when you sing
Give some fives to your friends
It's a dance of your hands

Stomp your feet on the ground
On your toes turn around
When you walk and feel the beat 
It's a dance of your feet

 Every single body part
 Like to dance, like to dance
 To the rhythm of your heart
 Every time they have a chance

 Every single body part
 Like to dance, like to dance
 To the rhythm of your heart
 Every time they have a chance",kids dance learning,true

He says, ""This is Thriller,"" you're going to go, ""Thriller"" and a three and four. You're going to go, right, left, look, look. ""Cause this is,"" one, two. One, two, and a three and a four, five. We're going to go, five, six, seven and eight. One and a two, hold, three, and four. And five, six, seven, look, look.

Now, Michael does a turn. The zombies go on the floor. You can choose to do both if you want. You can do a spin move, one, or you can do two spins. Whatever you're feeling. The zombies are going to go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You have one whole count of eight to come up as a zombie or you have two or three counts to do a spin. So, whatever you're feeling. That is your first four counts of the main chorus.

Lyrics:
Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only four ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Four little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only three ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3.

Three little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only two ghosts flew.

1, 2. 

Two little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only one ghost flew.

1. 

One little ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house no little ghosts flew. 

Sad mother ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew. 

Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew.

Hello this is Gino Fort and I'm going to teach you how to bot. 

Now, botting is composed of different techniques in one, but it's very stiff, very stiff. It's not loose at all.

You're not even human, that's why you're a robot, that's why it's botting. So basically it deals with hitting a little bit. Hitting does help but not too much because robots don't hit all the time, they walk like a robot. So basically you have slow motion walks, you have regular walks.

Now your slow motion walks can go in with your regular walks. You can be walking regularly like a robot and then just slow it down really slow, as so, but make sure you still look like a robot. While you're doing that you can isolate your body to move other places as well while you're robotting so it makes it very unique and unreal. So various stops with your arms, stops like with your right and left arms, right, left, right, left, right, left, right left, right, left, bing, up. You're moving one thing at a time. Don't go too fast; don't rush it because you won't look like a robot. You'll look human. 

So when you do that you can do stops, one, two, three, four, turn head, neck. Everything is one at a time. That means everything is one at a time. Neck, head, torso, body, arm, arm, arm, arm, arm. Basically you get the point. Basically I'm going to start to routine off with walking. Make it very robotic. If you have to add your own little extra flavor in it, come around someway, however you want to, that's you.

And when the routine starts you're going to go slightly forward and it's going to be like a retraction. So you're going to go back, boom like you hit the wall. So one, two, three, and stop. Take your right arm five, six with your left, and you're going to go up, seven, and eight. Now that itself is going to be like a back and forth. You're going to stop as so. 

So let's try it again. You're going to walk very robotic turn head, left however you want to. Feet you can do in a different order, but when the routine starts you're going to go back, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and an eight.

Let's try it again just from the start of the routine. Five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, and four. Five, six, seven, and an eight. You're walking, boom, boom, boom. Slow motion if you will, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two and three, and four, five, six, seven, and an eight. Now let's try that with music.",kids dance learning,true

Children will learn the moves to this fun Hip Hop dance song! 

Hip Hop (Slow) is a great brain breaks action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
‚Ä¢ refresh
‚Ä¢ recharge
‚Ä¢ refocus
‚Ä¢ regenerate
‚Ä¢ release stress
‚Ä¢ breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also great for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Hip Hop (Slow)
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 

LYRICS:

My name is Hip Hop Don with street clothes on.
I'm here to show you whereupon
I say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.

Now face your palms down. The points of your fingers face each other.
Lift up and push down, that's good, let's do another.
But this time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.
Just like a puppet string, (it's attached)
It moves at your command. Right knee, up down, (3X) left knee, up down, (3X)

Chorus:
Keep doing it, you got that right.
This hip hop stuff is out of sight.
And now let's try a brand new thing.
In a while, right now let's sing.
H to the I, I to the P, that's hip... H to the O, O to the P, that's hop. It's hip hop.

Use your hands to fan your face.
Keep doing this and keep the pace. 
And while you're doing that, take giant steps to the right and to the left.

Repeat Chorus

Stand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat (in and out)
Now bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat
Add your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat
Make your way back up, that move is complete.

Repeat Chorus

Point your toes, first in then out.
And that will move you all about.
Now raise your arms swing them around,
Side to side, up and down.

Repeat Chorus

Hands on your knees now jump real small, it looks just like your sliding.
Jump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and...
Use your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!
A ""Y"" hand means, WHATEVER! And an open hand means STOP!
Repeat Chorus (2x to end)

‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/Bailey
Physical activity can prevent depression and learned helplessness by acting on the serotonin circuits. 
Get up and move! Emotional states are called ‚Äúaction sets‚Äù because they prepare us to act in certain ways. When we feel good on the inside, we learn better and act better on the outside. Let‚Äôs Boogie! 
(Everyone sing the first verse in unison. During the Chorus touch your head, your feet, then shake, shout and rock to the beat. Follow the directions in each verse and keep doing that same 
movement throughout the Refrains.) 
LYRICS:
Blues, blues go away. We want to sing and dance today.
Blues, blues go away. Brain Boogie Boosters are here to stay.
[Chorus] Get the brain boogie rockin‚Äô beat 
From your head, down to your feet. 
Everybody wiggle, shake and shout. Yeah!
That‚Äôs what this boogie song is all about.
Hold your arms up way high.
Cross your hands up in the sky.
Cross your ankles, bend your knees,
Wiggle down to the beat.
[Refrain] Wiggle down-Wiggle up-Wiggle down-Wiggle up
Shake it left-Shake it right-Shake it left-Shake it right
We clap to the beat. We step with our feet.
Brain boogie rockin‚Äô is really neat.
[Repeat Chorus]
Left hand to right toe, right hand to left toe
Twice as fast, now touch and go
Left and right, to and fro 
[Repeat Refrain]
[Repeat Chorus]
Hold your arms down by your sides. 
Jump up and down but not too high. Cross your arms behind your back. Now, jump just like a jumping jack. [Repeat Refrain]

Little pilgrim clothed in gray

come to visit Plymouth Town.
Side by side they ate and prayed,
on that first Thanksgiving Day.
Let‚Äôs be thankful for this day,

Let‚Äôs be thankful, let‚Äôs be glad,

‚òÖ Lyrics
We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A ghostly, ghoulish goblin waving cheerfully. 
He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A very vain vampire waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.
SOUND EFFECT- Door closing to a slam!

Monster Moves by Koo Koo Kanga Roo (C) 2017

Lyrics: 
Give it up for the monster crew
Definitely more scary than you
isn't that what we're suppose to do?
Pop out the dark and say boo
everyone here is spooky 
This song right here's a doosy
Straight outta horror movie
but now we want to boogie
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Let me see your monster moves
Let me see your monster moves
After midnight let's hit the street
Terrify every soul we meet
Scare a hundred kids man, that sounds sweet 
err-single night, Wash-rinse-repeat
Undead but  grooving
And the beat it is so soothing
Make you wonder what we're doing
And we call it monster moving 
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves
Let me see your monster moves
Monster Monster Monster Moves

All right monsters I know youre in the house.
Let me hear you. I need to hear you.
All the mummies, let me hear you say TP TP
All the zombies, let me hear you say brains brains
All the werewolves, let me hear you say hairy palms hairy palms
All the ghosts, let me hear you say boo boo

Edwin: So now we're going to talk about beginner steps. This is a very short pattern. You are going to start to the left on one, two, three, tap, five, six, seven. Then you're going to go outside and middle, top, outside and middle, top, outside and middle, top. Outside and forward, for one,two, three and slide six.

And basic and one, two, three. Half to the right, half to the left, and five, six, seven. Now let's break it down. This pattern is going to start with the basics, so lets do the basic first, five, six, seven and one, two, three tap, five, six, seven break from here. We're going to push the weight to the outside, open step, middle break. Then we're going to do it on the other side. Open step, middle break. Gentleman, notice how my shoulders are rolling as I go out. Open,step. 

Daniela: And ladies don't forget your hips. They're going out and tap. 

Edwin: And gentlemen, make sure that you use the same distance that you're going to the left, also to the right. Now the next part is going to go forward, you're going to lead with your left leg in front. Five, six, seven and one, two, tap behind and slide. Lets try that again. And one, two, tap behind and slide. 

So make sure you're dragging out your foot as much as you can, up to the last number and then we go to the left. So now we're going to do the last part. And one, two, three, tap. Here you want to have your foot in front of you, because your going to lead yourself forward into a twist. So you're going to go, twist to the right, tap and same thing, twist to the left, tap and basic to the right. 

Now lets put it together a little bit faster and then with music, five, six, seven, eight and one, two, three, tap, five, six, seven, tap. Outside stomp, middle, outside stomp, middle, outside and outside, now forward and one, two, tap behind and slide. And basic step, twist to the right, twist to the left and five, six, seven, eight. Make sure your confident and secure. Now let's try it with music.  

Daniela: Ladies remember your hips, also you can style. 

Edwin: And gentlemen, shoulders. And feel secure, nice and strong.

Daniela: Same thing here. You can slide back with the arms and basic.

Edwin: Twist.

Daniela: Twist, booty out. 

Edwin: And five, six and seven. Gentlemen, don't be afraid to move your hips on the twist. The ladies do it, it's okay for us to do it as well and that is your simple bachata pattern.",kids dance learning,true

In this video, we‚Äôre going to learn one of the most useful and universal combinations of steps in the history of tap dance, the traditional 'Time Step'.

--- Note: This video is 100% relevant for 2020, even though it was published in 2018 ---

The ‚ÄòTime Step‚Äô has a rich history, dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. Today, they pop up everywhere: classes, auditions, shows and films. 

There are many different types and variations of the Time Step that have appeared throughout the years, and many of these variations are practiced today. 

The ‚ÄôTraditional Time Step‚Äô that I show you in this video is effectively the ‚ÄòBase Pattern‚Äô. Once you‚Äôve got this pattern down, learning alternate time step variations becomes a relatively simple task.

A COMMON TIME STEP VARIATION:
(Especially for USA based viewers)
One of the most common alternates involves substituting a Stomp (a flat foot, without weight), or a Stomp-Spank (Spank the toe straight after the Stomp) for the Shuffle on count 8. 

It is my hope that this video will give you a flying start toward discovering the Single, Double and Triple Time Steps. I hope it helps. If you enjoy it, please like and share this video, and tell me how you went in the comments! I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Watch more How to Dance the Cha-Cha videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/511250-4-Basic-Elements-of-ChaCha-ChaCha-Dance



Aaron:  Hi guys, I'm Aaron.

Christina:  And I'm Christina. 

Aaron:  Coming at you today from Dance Times Square here in New York City. Today, we're talking about the four elements of the cha-cha basic. Our first element is what we call walking steps. Forward and backward. Forward, forward, forward, just as simple as that, and replacing back where we came from. And walk, walk, walk and back, back, back. Just as easy as walking down the street. 

Now with our cha-cha we're going to be talking about a little bit of a different kind of quality of action, this being a dance that's come over from Cuba in the late 1940's. We're going to add a little bit of a Cuban action to this and place more emphasis, on putting our weight on the balls of our feet. So we're going to dance this forward a little bit more. One, two, three and back again, one, two, three. 

Now our second element of the cha-cha basic is going to be a side step. We're going to start in this dance with our left foot and we're going to start side, together, side, together, side. And just the same back in the direction we were coming from, to our right. Side, together, side, together, side. Again, with a little bit of that Cuban action, as well. Side, together, side, together. Really digging down and back where we came from, to our right. Again, side, together, side, together, side. 

Christina:  And the last element we're going to talk about is the rock step. You take your left foot and you're just going to place it behind you. You're going to step back and put your weight back on your right foot. So weight on the left foot, weight on the right foot, and again, we're going to add that Cuban hip motion in. You're going to step back and replace forward, back, replace, back, replace. 

The trick to this move is, I'll show you from the side. You want to keep the movement underneath your body, so you don't want to think of stepping back and forward. You want to keep it very small. It's just going to be right underneath your body, back and forward, back and forward. Great.

Aaron:  Okay, guys. So just to recap, the four elements of the cha-cha basic were; walking steps, forward, backward, sidesteps and the fourth element, the rock step. Now we're going to take those, and put those together, and make up our cha-cha basic. Just like so, side, rock, step, side, together, side, rock, step, side together side, rock, step. Now forward and backward with the walking steps,cha-cha-cha, rock, step, cha-cha-cha, rock, step and side, together, side. 

Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two. Cha-cha, one, two, three, forward, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three, side together, side.",kids dance learning,true

Lyrics
Everybody stand up
Everybody spread your feet
Keep  your arms straight, your hands in fists
And a little bend your knees
Slide your hips out to the left and to the right
Swing your arms straight together side to side

Do the Floss Dance 
Everybody's doin' it now
Do the Floss Dance
Just get on up and get on down
Do the Floss Dance
All the world is having fun
Do the Floss Dance, do it everyone

Floss, floss, floss,floss, floss,floss, floss,floss, floss
Floss, floss, floss,floss, floss,floss, floss,floss, floss

Everybody stand up
Everybody spread your feet
Keep  your arms straight, your hands in fists
And a little bend your knees
Slide your hips out to the left and to the right
Swing your arms straight together side to side

Do the Floss Dance 
Everybody's doin' it now
Do the Floss Dance
Just get on up and get on down
Do the Floss Dance
All the world is having fun
Do the Floss Dance, do it everyone

Dance by yourself or with your friends
You can do it if you think you can
Fell the beat, get in the groove

The Floss Dance is really cool
Floss, floss, floss, move your body
Floss, floss, floss, everybody
Floss, floss, floss, move your body
Doing the Floss Dance

Hokey Pokey
From All-Time Childrens' Favorites
By The Learning Station
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
Lyrics:
You put your right foot in, you take your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your right arm in, you take your right arm out, you put your right arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you take your left arm out, you put your left arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

Square Dance Cadence
by The Learning Station
From the CD, Kid's Country Song & Dance
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station (All rights reserved.)

Lyrics
(Follow the directions, repeat each line, and answer YEA! in the choruses)
Stand up straight make a country line.
We‚Äôre all spruced up and looking fine.
Ya‚Äôll do what I do and say what I say,
Country square dance, HIP HURRAY!
March in place and groove to the beat.
Clap and stomp your country feet.
Swing your lasso overhead.
Bring it down, now put it to bed.

Chorus: Can you feel it?-YEA! Can you do it?-YEA!
You want more? YEA! Square Dance till the cows come home.
Turn and face your partner friend.
Shake their hand and bow your head.
Now do-se-do and holler ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù
Get on your horse and gallop away.
Stand in place and clap along.
Twiddle your thumbs to this song.
Girls all curtsy, boys please bow.
Tip your hat, wag your tail like a cow. Repeat Chorus
Bend your knees up and down.
Wiggle your shoulders all around.
Fiddle your banjo strings real fast.
Stomp one boot to the YEEHA BLAST!
Stand up straight, arms by your side.
Rock back and forth, like a PONY RIDE!
Swing your lasso shout YAHOO!
Climb off your horse and dust your shoe.
Hands on your waist, flap em‚Äô around
Wag your tail feathers, to this sound.
Tell your partner HOWDY HO!
Spin around and do-se-do. Repeat Chorus
Bounce in place to the country beat.
Jump up high, then sit on your seat.
Turn to your partner one last time.
Shake their hand, here comes a rhyme.
Say twiddle dee, twiddle doo.
It‚Äôs been real fun square dancin‚Äô with you!
Tip your hat for a proper goodbye.
A big country smile and the wink of an eye.

A little bit about us, ""Masaka Kids Africana ''""is the group \ Foundation of young talented Kids in Dancing, from Uganda - Masaka, East Africa,village called Nyendo - Kayirikiti, 

We DANCE - RISE AND SHINE.. 

****OUR VISION****** To empower children, mobilize communities and build futures. 

****OUR MISSION***** We Supporting children in education and social well being, through their talents. 

The Masaka Kids Africana is composed of African children, from the age of 2 and up. Many have lost one or both parents through the devastation of war, famine and disease. They represent all the children of a continent and they demonstrate the potential of African children to become strong leaders for a better future in their land. 
The children melt the hearts of audiences with their charming smiles and delightful African tunes, accompanied by vibrant dance moves. Nearly every performance is concluded with a thunderous standing ovation. A marvelous by-product of the concert is the inspiration the music brings to virtually every listener. In spite of the tragedy that has marred their young lives, the children are radiant with hope, musically gifted and wonderfully entertaining. 

We rely on the generosity of our extended family ‚Äî people like you ‚Äî so we can educate, feed, clothe and support all of our children. Every dollar we save from our performance is also a dollar earned for the continued care of our kids. Our music and dance troupe children will soon begin training again during their school term breaks and over select weekends. Show your support of music and advocacy ‚Äì it‚Äôs so easy to do. 

Masaka Kids Africana sponsored children have gone through some of the worst experiences a child could face ‚Äî but through dance and song and sharing their love of Uganda, these children connect to each other and the world. They see their own potential ‚Äî they have hope for their future.",kids dance learning,false

Lyrics: 

Can you whip you your tail like a dinosaur

Whip, whip 
Can you whip you your tail like a dinosaur 

Whip, whip 
Come on everybody get on the floor
And let me hear that ferocious roar
Can you whip your tail like a dinosaur 

Can you reach up to the sky 
Grab a leaf in the tree so high 
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Reach, reach, reach, reach 

Can you stomp, stomp, stomp 
on the ground, on the group so loud 
on the ground so loud 
Stomp, stomp, stomp
On the ground so loud 
Can you stomp so loud, can you stomp on the ground

I'd like to lay down or maybe just sit.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,
some rest some rest I know and stop the wiggles for good.

I got the wiggles for about a week
My legs are shaky I can hardly speak.
I got the wiggles bad I can't slow down.
If I could shake them I could get some rest,
some rest some rest I know

Also, it's from our collection of music videos titled, All Aboard released in 1990. This is NOT to be confused with The Australian band The Wiggles. The Learning Station is recognized for their brain breaks, action & dance songs for kids.

The Sasun Dance Group is just one of the many initiatives that COAF has implemented to help enrich children in the villages of the Armavir Region with extracurricular activities, sports, and the arts. COAF aims to provide students with opportunities to experience alternative ways of learning and to develop personal interests and talents in an informal environment.

Background: With roots in the years of the Byzantine Empire, the 'hasapiko' (œáŒ±œÉŒ¨œÄŒπŒ∫Œø) has become perhaps the most famous Greek dance to non-Greeks since it was choreographed as the 'sirtaki' (œÉœÖœÅœÑŒ¨Œ∫Œπ) for Anthony Quinn in the 1964 film 'Zorba the Greek'. It is sometimes also called the ""sailors' dance.""",kids dance learning,false

That was great! I got another dance we could try. Just twist with your hips. Ready, cause it goes like this. Twist your hips high, twist your hips low, twist them in the middle and twist them in a row. We're doing the twist. I like it like this. Let's twist right down to the ground. Lower, lower, keep twisting. Now up. That's it, the twist!
Okay everybody, now I feel like getting funky. Get down and do the Monkey. Fist over fist, just like this. Now we're getting funky. Get down and do the Monkey. Do it fast. It's a blast. Dancing now we're dancing.
Arms out to the side, you've got two wings. It's a dance they call the Fly. What fun it brings, it's a crazy thing. The Fly. My, my, my do the Fly. Oh yeah, flap those wings. We're taking off now, yeah!

Here's the world premiere of the full routine: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z5ZhKLNaHo

This is a Great Gatsby inspired workout, not affiliated with Warner Bros. All dance moves are reminiscent of the 1920s and the cardio dance routine was choreographed by fitness instructor Cassey Ho as a way to celebrate the premiere of the movie, The Great Gatsby. This can be considered a parody.

They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I'll make you do it all again

I said, ""Oh my god, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin‚Äô my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
dance monkey lyrics

So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh

And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

8,lbwgXba9aYE,The Karate Kid,[],"When a 12-year-old from Detroit moves to China with his mother and incurs the wrath of the class bully at his new school, he makes an unlikely ally in the form of his aging maintenance man, a kung fu master who teaches him the secrets to self-defense. Upon arriving at his new school, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) develops a powerful crush on pretty classmate Mei Ying. The feeling is mutual, although the cultural divide between Dre and Mei Ying makes a friendship unlikely, and romance impossible. When cruel classmate and kung fu prodigy Cheng learns of Dre's feelings for Mei Ying, he harasses and humiliates the young outsider in front of the entire school. With no one to turn to for help, Dre confides his fears in kindly maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a kung fu master who knows that serenity and maturity -- not punches and power -- are the true keys to mastering the martial arts. As Dre prepares to face down his intimidating tormentor, he begins to realize that the real fight is just beginning.",kids dance learning,true

Best song for your Father Daughter Wedding Dance - ""Daddy"". It characterizes Abby's love for her own father, as well as how she feels a father can influence his children, especially his daughter. All you dad's out there better have a tissue ready!

LYRICS:
Well daddy I came here today
'cause I think I might have found the one
Oh yeah I'm head over heels in love and
I bet I can tell you what you're thinking of

Yeah you're wondering
how I know he's it
Well my whole life
I have a dad who showed me what a real man is

Cause daddy he loves me just like you do
He treats me like a queen just like you, just like you do
He's my shoulder to cry on, he's my best friend
Oh and daddy, he loves me just like you

He respects and he respects me
You always keep your word, you're always honest and so was he
And just like you dad, he's forgiving and he knows my worth
Knows me for who I am, he's everything you believe I deserve

Cause daddy he loves me just like you do
He treats me like a queen just like you, just like you do
He's my shoulder to cry on, he's my best friend
Oh and daddy, he loves me just like you

I'm grown up now, daddy can't you see
For all of your actions, you taught me everything I want my husband to be

Cause daddy he loves me just like you do
He treats me like a queen just like you, just like you do
He's my shoulder to cry on, he's my best friend
Oh and daddy, he loves me just like you
Oh and daddy, he loves me just like you
Hmmm...
Just like you

As a former substitute teacher, I understand how each child learns differently. I created the KT Diddle Show to help children learn via sight and sound. If your child is an auditory or visual learner, the KT Diddle Show can help them comprehend words and numbers better. 

I had dyslexia as a child. It was difficult learning to write, spell, and to keep numbers in order. I would sometimes write my letters backwards or upside down and my numbers would be flipped. I‚Äôve pretty much overcome dyslexia; I make sure to review my work. Together, with a little extra effort, your child can overcome their adversity, just like I did. Join me each week on YouTube. There will be music, colorful pictures, and best of all, puppets! Parents, please be sure to like and subscribe! THANKS! KT Diddle :)

HEY EVERYBODY!! Welcome back to the Cave Club!! We have some new members for you to meet! their names are Rockelle and Tryasaurs! Rockelle is the girl doll and Tyra is her dinosaur best friend!! Rockelle and her friend Emberly noticed that there has been sightings of Dino Baby Crystals all over Pirate Island so they wanted to go on an adventure to rescue all of them! I played as Rockelle and my mom played as Emberly. We searched all over the place like up in trees, in the river, and in caves! When we got close to the cave we met up with Tyra who was being played as my dad!! It was so fun grouping up and searching all over the land for new dino babies! We found 3 friends scattered around the island and then we took them home to our treehouse to take care of them! It was so fun playing with these new toys!!

36,PXvh08Mnork,"Tooty Ta: A Dance for All Ages - Tooty Ta, a great ice breaker","Music nurtures phonemic awareness,First grade,1st Grade,Kindergarten,Pre-K,Pre-kindergarten (Grade Level),parents,teachers,top ten reasons to SING every day","An all-time favorite of both teachers and students, Dr. Jean has posted the Tooty Ta video from her DVD, Let's Sing, Dance and Learn. Preschools, kindergarten and elementary schools have all used this for graduation ceremonies.

Tooty Ta: A Dance for All Ages - Tooty Ta, a great ice breaker. Dr. Jean's songs are on iTunes. Tooty Ta is on the CD Dr. Jean and Friends.

Here are the top ten reasons to SING every day!

1. When you sing your brain emits endorphins, and endorphins make you happy!  Emotions are critical to learning.

2. Music is multi-sensory.  The more senses you get going to the brain, the more likely the message will get there.

3. Music is powerful for prior-learning.  If children are exposed to concepts while singing, it is easier for them to learn when formally introduced.

4. Music nurtures phonemic awareness (alliteration, rhyme, etc.).

5. Songs and chants are a natural way to develop oral language and auditory memory.

6. Poems and songs lay a foundation for fluency and enhance short term memory.

7. Children are able to use their imaginations and create pictures in their brains when they sing.  This is an important part of reading comprehension.

 8. Repetition is a key to learning.  It is much more fun to repeat songs than worksheets!

 9. Singing and dancing relieve stress and oxygenate the brain.

10. Through music and movement ALL children can feel successful.  A ‚Äúcommunity of learners‚Äù is enhanced when teachers and children enjoy something together!

There was a study that was reported on National Public Radio called ‚ÄúAlive Inside.‚Äù  In the research study they made iPods of songs that had a special significance to patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs.  These patients didn‚Äôt recognize family members, but when they heard the music they tapped their feet, sang the words, and smiled!  So many things that we do in our classrooms will be forgotten, but the songs will be stored in children‚Äôs brains for a lifetime!  What a privilege to be able to do this!",kids dance learning,true

The kids love the music this monster truck plays and when we turn it on they start dancing!  It's really fun for them to rock out to the road rippers crocodile monster truck.  This is an awesome monster truck that has huge teeth and does wheelies, it's eyes light up too which is pretty cool. 

There were some party balloons left over from Nathan's birthday party so we blew them up to make things more colorful.   Along with all the dancing and crazy monster truck driving around the room we reinforced learning colors.

Lyrics
Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move
Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try
Do your best, pump your muscles up
Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Move like windshield wipers working in the rain
Sway your arms back and forth wipe the rain away

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a racehorse running on the track
Gallop like a horse moving smooth and fast

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a dancer grooving to the beat
Rollin',  rockin', Hip-hoppin' 
From your head down to your feet

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

Move like a sports star get ready for the race
Stretching, flexing, shooting for first place
Let's move, let's move

Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try
Do your best, pump your muscles up
Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Your body is amazing it can do so many things
Run, jump, twist, turn, dance, learn and sing
So keep your body healthy, treat it like a friend
Take care of it and eat good foods
And keep it movin'

On this day reach up for the sky
You're a winner when you go and try
Do your best, pump your muscles up
Make your dreams come true, stay strong and tough

Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move
Let's move, let's move
Get your body in the groove
Build your body and your brain
Everybody let's move

If your children love to dance and move this is a brain breaks song you'll want to use over and over again. 

It has a cowboy theme with very cool country Hip - Hop groove your children will just love. Your children will be engaged in movement and fun and singing ""Yipee yi ya"" all together. This brain breaks song has simple movements that repeat so children will easily learn this dance and move along.

Classroom teachers, PE teachers and parents can use this song to get children up and moving, having fun, and get a little break from their academic work. It's a brain breaks song that's really different with a cool cowboy theme.

LYRICS:

Yippee Yi Yo ‚ÄìYippy Yi, Ya (3x)         Chorus
Do the Cowboy Dance this way

I've got my cowboy hat
I‚Äôve got my cowboy boots
I love to sing and move
And do the Cowboy Dance with you

(children sing)

Now spread your feet out wide ‚Äìwide
Point knees out to each side‚Äìside
Then bend knees up and down ‚Äì down
Right to this cowboy sound ‚Äì sound
Raise one arm up high ‚Äì high
Your lasso in the sky
Ride your horse, take a chance
Lets all do the Cowboy Dance

Yippee Yi Yo ‚ÄìYippy Yi, Ya (3x)
Do the Cowboy Dance this way

Repeat Dance Moves

Learn some new cowboy steps
Right foot out toe up, clap and stomp
Left foot out toe up, clap and stomp
Now, left foot out, quarter turn left,right foot stomp
Now, right foot out, quarter turn right,left foot stomp
Do it again, ride your horse
Do the Cowboy Dance once more

Hey guys!

Your wish is my command! You asked for the Pop Lock dance tutorial (another Fortnite dance tutorial, yay), so here it is! üòâThanks for all the requests! Keep them coming üòä

This Pop Lock dance is the hardest one I've done so far, and if you want to master this one you need to know how to do the Crazy Legs Move and spins in general. Check out my tutorials on those:

Crazy Legs Move:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZF4sQcERPs&t=132s

Spins:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzCo27-lbr0

This video is just one of my many dance tutorials to come where I break down the dance moves step by step for you to learn. This is another dance move that you can add to your ""dance vocabulary"" üòä Use it in your freestyle dance, choreography or however you want üòä

Please let me know if you have any requests for future dance tutorials or if there's anything I could improve for future dance tutorials. Also, please like and subscribe if you liked it üòä

I hope you enjoy the video! Let's dance dance dance!

17,Uehi4sK81rg,Learning to Flow using Dance of Shiva,"dance of shiva,learning to flow,practicing flowing,flow for beginners,dance of shiva basics","A key to making the dance of shiva easy to learn is learning the basic positions and movements for one arm. This should be easy since there are only 8 basic positions and 8 basic movements. (And one of those movements is a zero move.)

In this video I show you a simple way to practice flowing between positions one arm at a time. At each state we limit the choices to particular positions or movements so that you can practice moving between them without thinking. 

If you are comfortable with all positions and movements using only one arm, it can then make it a lot easier to learn the positions and movements where both arms are used.

To learn more about the dance of shiva (including learning a good portion of all possible movements with both arms) check out the dance of shiva course. It includes videos, movement maps (pictures of the movements) and movement tables (a tool for seeing simple practice sets at a glance.)

Recently we had an amazing opportunity to take a private ICE DANCE Lesson With an OLYMPIC FIGURE SKATER - Dmitry Dun!

In this episode of our figure skating vlog we're gonna share the experience of training in ice dance like the cool kids! :)

--------------------------------

We're professional dancers who decided to try something new. Figure skating is usually perceived as a kid's activity and often adults feel like it's too late for them to start.
We decided to ditch this notion and prove with our example that it's never too late to try something new.
We hope our experience of learning ice skating as beginner adults (which is also a great workout) will inspire you to get active and get in shape and go after those points on your bucket list, too!

Follow our ice skating journey and be a part of our ice skating progression with our ice skating vlog every Thursday. Hope you enjoy our ice skating channel.

What's up yo? This is Kid Glyde. I'm here to teach you guys some breaking moves. For this one, I'm going to show you some basics. Well actually, what a beginner should know. Straight up. All right? Beginners should know, of course, the four elements of breaking. The four basic elements. There's more elements, but we'll go into that later. So anyways, we got top rock; we got the footwork, freezes and power moves, the eye candy of the whole dance.

All right. With top rock, you should have at least three steps. Three steps, Indian step, cross step and at least a side step. The three and you can do the back step. Back step's easy. Footwork, six step, two step, three step. It's very important to have the six step. Kick outs, step outs. You should have all that in my first series. Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying?

Power moves, first work on freezes to help you get the pop, you know, the strength to get the power moves such as table top, the baby, reverse baby. Then for swipes, I would say let's work on elevated chair. Elevated chair would look like this. All right. That will help you with your swipes and you'll be good. That's what a beginner should know, as a beginner. So, top rock, you've got the Indian step and then, the reverse to that, you got the back step.

Then, you've got the side step. Three basic top rock moves. A little bit more advanced, but still beginner, is the cross step. Know what I'm saying? Then you've got the footwork: step outs. A little faster. Switch hands. You got the kick outs. Step. Kick out, son. And you've got the six step, which I showed you all previously. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six.",kids dance learning,true

How to dance sexy! 
Hi, I'm Leshana. And today, I'm going to tell you how to drop it low. If you've ever been wondering, there's different ways that you can drop it low. But the whole point of it is just to drop low. So you can start the drop it low by facing front. You can start with your feet together, and bending your knees, and just go low. All the way low. You can keep dancing with your knees together, or you can start with your feet apart. 

And drop it low. And dance down here, with your feet apart. All it requires is just moving and having a good time, but you're on a low level. You can start to drop it low by facing the side. Drop it low. And groove it out. You can also drop it low by facing the back, and drop it low.

When you're in these low positions, you just want to make sure that your backside is going up, down, up, down, up, down. So facing front, my feet are together. My backside going up, down, up, down, up, down. Feet apart. I drop it low. Up, down, up, down, up, down. Facing the side. Drop it low. Up, down, up, down, up, down. And I turn to face the back. Drop it low. Up, down, up, down, up, down. And that is how you drop it low.",kids dance learning,true

35,_Rwk69i-FD8,Learn les couleurs (colours) in French through dance,"colours,les couleurs,French,Dance,Jouez,Dansez","The children of Mountfield Primary School in Newcastle demonstrate their dance routine for learning French colours (les couleurs).

Drama and movement provide the ideal way to teach a foreign language. By actively involving the body, learning comes more naturally and it is easier to retain what has been learned. 

This simple routine combines movements with repetition of important phrases, making learning colours (les couleurs) in French easy and enjoyable.

This routine is taken from Jouez, Dansez et Apprenez le Fran√ßais, a book and DVD set which provides an active learning approach to learning popular French topics. For each topic, in addition to the main dance routine, there is also a bank of movement activities that introduce and reinforce the vocabulary, enabling the whole topic to be taught actively.

Being a B-Boy, if you don't have confidence, everybody  will see that you‚Äôre not confident and they'll see that you‚Äôre just lacking in moves or just lacking in self-esteem.  You need to come out hard and present yourself well.  Just like in life, straight up.  

Alright, I'm going to show you a few things. All this stuff that you're learning, from me of course, you just got to build it but now we are going to work on different things.  

Speed, angles and a little bit of creativity.  Here at Dynamic Rockers Academy, we created a concept called the box. So, check it out. Simple moves. Make sure, that if your leg goes forward, right, if this is your seat, whenever you do a forward move, you come back here, any move. Most of the moves you come back here. This is your seat. When I kick my leg forward, I lean back.  You created an angle.  You created an illusion.  Look at that.  That doesn't look cool.  That looks better.  Come back, my leg kicks out, the rest of my body goes the opposite direction.  

It creates an angle.  Same thing, when I go forward, my hands go forward and my legs go back.  Back to the seat.  Other side.  See that, angle, instead of, that doesn't look cool.  Just like any art form, we have angle and we have lines.  We have to create them.  

Simple step.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Simple step.  Now if I ad speed to it, now it looks like I know what I'm doing.  I look more advanced.  So we hit the corners.  Opposite direction with the rest of your body.  You got to play with the angles.  This will make you look a lot better, trust me.  Instead of, ain't going to happen.

Why do we dance? African-American social dances started as a way for enslaved Africans to keep cultural traditions alive and retain a sense of inner freedom. They remain an affirmation of identity and independence. In this electric demonstration, packed with live performances, choreographer, educator and TED Fellow Camille A. Brown explores what happens when communities let loose and express themselves by dancing together.

All right you guys, this next one is called the whacking arms, these are
crazy fun, fast arms to get your upper body working. So I want you to start
with your feet kinda right underneath your hips, softly bend your knees,
right? Bring your arms up, now keep blades with your hands, so really have
nice, closed, tight palms and energy reaching through your fingers. Now
bend your knees, you're going to put your right arm in front of your forehead,
your left arm behind your head. Okay? So I'm going to turn to the side just so
that you can see what that looks like. Okay? Now I'm going to come back to you.

So from here open and then switch, left and front, right and back. Okay? And
then quick, quick, quick. So too slow and then too quick, so you're going to
start again, right arm in front. Slow, slow, quick, quick, quick. Slow,
slow, quick, quick, quick. Slow, slow, quick, quick, quick. Slow, slow,
quick, quick, quick. Now you're going to feel that once you keep your elbows
out, you're going to start to feel your shoulders and your arm muscles
working. 

I'm going to face the side just in case you're confused as to where
the hands go. So again, right arm goes in front first, right, left, one,
two, three. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow.
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. Okay? Most important thing is you trying not
to hit yourself, right? Keep your hands a nice distance from your head and
from your face, so that you don't actually whack yourself in the face, Okay?
So, lower body is going to stay right here, knees are bent. Just keep your
core engaged, let your hips be loose and free, okay? Let's take it up in
tempo. Arms out, be careful don't hit yourself. Ready? Whacking arms, one,
two, one, two, three. One, two, two, three. Hip, hip, quick, quick, quick.
One, two, ta, ta, ta. Pa, pa, pa, pa. Pa, pa, pa, pa. One, two, two, three.
One, two, two three. All right, I definitely feel that, Yes? That's a fast
one that you can take slow. Take it on a slower tempo if you need to,
otherwise challenge yourself and speed it up. You will feel the burn in
your arms, and you're going to look good doing it, all right? Enjoy.",kids dance learning,true

Best Wild Animal Day Ever 1156

Good morning vlog!! Today we start out with a tour of our newest basement fort neighborhood. This one is extra special because it has our own backyard, toy and relaxation rooms for each of us, plus our very own backyard! But you have to be careful in the backyard, if you do the animal call, wild animals will show up and it's scary!! After playing that with the kiddos all morning, Jenny comes down to see what this mornings routine has looked like. 

We are way into craft time these days and today we have the plan to make some DIY cup phones! The kiddos and I sit at the kitchen table and start decorating our phones, making silly faces for them and connecting them with string. After a few talking tests (like speed tests, but much cooler), we head downstairs to keep playing and talking to each other!!

It's then off to the lake where we play cops and robbers with the pirate jail, Niko learns to ride his bike on the pump track, and Adley helps me feed the fish in the lake. We also have a dance party where the kiddos dance crazy, even baby Navey!!

""What up y'all? My name is Tweet Boogie. I represent the South Bronx, had my first hip-hop crew at fourteen, done some work with Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child, traveled all over the world cause I teach hip-hop culture, and right now I'm ready to teach you some dances for the club. Let's get it started. So, my time to shine, sexy dance moves for women.  Ladies, we're going to do the dip, and move your hip. Right? So, I need your feet together, and I'm going to stand at an angle so you can see it. So, feet together, place your hands on your thighs, and bend your knees. You might want to arch just a little bit. Just a little bit to keep the silhouette cute. So what you're going to do is bend your knees, and as you bend your knees your hips are going to go to the right. Boom. And, we're going to dip again, and you're going to go to the left. Dip to the left. You see how I'm still arched? You don't want to be straight because then you look surprised, ooh. So you want to stay arched. So you want to dip again. Dip again to the left. Dip again to the right. I'm going to try my sexy moves on my partner over here. So come on over here to me. Good. Are you ready?

I'm ready.

So, OK, usually when a guy watches a female do this dip, there's really nothing that he would do except for a two-step, which would be from side to side. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So really you let the female do all the work. But don't just stand there looking at her, gawking at her. So you got to do a simple two-step, right? Boom. So we're going to try this with music so I can get my sexy on. DJ! Good, so now I'm going to take it low on him. Good.  Make sure that you keep the arch in your back. Good, and dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. Good, I think my partner is dipping with me. Yes he is! Good, dip, dip, dip, dip. You might want to look at him. How you doing? Yeah he's back there. So that was your sexy dance move for women. So what'd you think?

It was great.

It was great, of course, it was great.",kids dance learning,true

Hey everybody, I'm LaShonna.

And I'm Victor Sho.

And today, we're going to learn the butterfly. The butterfly is an old-school reggae dance. It's done primarily with the legs, so we're going to just focus on the legs today, and then Victor and I are going to show you a partnered-version of the butterfly, the double-butterfly, so to speak.

The double-butterfly.

So, we're going to start with our legs. You have to start with your knees bent, on your tippy-toes, is the best way to start. Knees in, knees out, think of yourself doing the Thighmaster exercise. Knees in, knees out, knees in, knees out. Now, how do we get to the butterfly? We add our pelvis. When your knees come in, your pelvis pushes your knees apart, and your pelvis goes back. Knees in, push the knees apart. Knees in, pelvis pushes the knees apart, and push, and open, and push, and open. Now you can add your arms, for a scooping motion, to add onto the butterfly.

So, let's do a single-leg, single-leg, double-leg butterfly. We're going to start with the right. Right leg,  left leg,  now both go two times. Right leg again. Right leg, left leg, both legs. Make sure you're pushing, push! Push! Both legs. One more time. Right, left, push. Good. So now Victor and I are going to show you how you can partner up into a butterfly with your friends. So I'm going to do a low butterfly, Victor's going to be high. We're going to go single, single, double. Ready, Victor?

Yes.

5, 6, 7, you have single, single, and double. One more time. Single, single, and double. Awesome. And that is the butterfly.",kids dance learning,true

Loretta: Hey, everybody. What's up? My name is Loretta. This is my twin sister Ava, and this is Anthony, and right now we're going to teach you how to dance at a high school dance. So really, Monday through Friday, you're in high school and you're in class, you're at lunch. You know you're learning, you're studying, you're working, right? So time when you get to high school dance, you want to just have fun. So we're going to show you three moves that you could do to have fun and dance with your friends. 

Anthony: You just let loose. Let loose and have a good time.

Ava: That's what it's all about, right?

Loretta: Okay, so the first move is just a basic, say you have three friends, right? It's a guy and two girls, okay? We could just do a basic snake, and a step touch, and everyone goes to the right, okay? Five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, that's fun and interacting. You're hanging out with your friends. It's something just simple, cool and easy. 

Anthony: Now the second step that we're going to learn is just a simple step touch, moving around the circle and just having a good time. Keep engaged with your friends and just let loose. High school dances are just about getting away from your studies and having a good time. So let's break it down. We're in a circle; five, six, seven, eight; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip; step touch, step touch and turn, and hip. 

Ava:  Awesome, so that's the second move that you can do at a high school dance. The third move you could do is when you are in a circle, you guys are all in it together, you could push it down and then breeze through and push down; breeze through and push down, and breeze through and push down, and breeze through.

Ava:  Awesome, so those are the three moves that you could do with your friends at a high school dance. Let's go through them one more time together. So the first move, snake; five, six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight; awesome.

Anthony:  Now our second move is step touch with a circle; five, six, seven eight; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 

Loretta and Ava: Awesome.

Ava:  Third move, push it down, breeze through; five, six, seven, eight. Push it down, breeze through, push it down, breeze through, push it down, breeze through, push it down, breeze through.

Loretta:  So those are three moves that you could do, with your friends at a high school dance.",kids dance learning,true

Watch Descendants 3 on Friday, August 2, 2019 on Disney Channel! (U.S.)

Mal (Dove Cameron), Evie (Sofia Carson), Carlos (Cameron Boyce) and Jay (BooBoo Stewart) return to the Isle of the Lost to recruit a new batch of villainous offspring to join them at Auradon Prep.  When a barrier breach jeopardizes the safety of Auradon during their departure off the Isle, Mal resolves to permanently close the barrier, fearing that nemeses Uma (China Anne McClain) and Hades (Cheyenne Jackson) will wreak vengeance on the kingdom.  Despite her decision, an unfathomable dark force threatens the people of Auradon, and it's up to Mal and the VKs to save everyone in their most epic battle yet.

You wanna learn how to do the ""Thriller"" Dance? FUNKMODE's got you covered! In this FREE instructional video, Mighty and KMDZ teach you step by step and with counts. The choreography we explain is from the original music video and falls between the moment when Michael first appears as a zombie to the beginning of the final chorus.

We made this video to be short, so we don't go over each step a ton of times. But don't worry because all of the essential info is there. Just run the video back as often as you need to until you get the steps. And MAKE SURE TO WATCH UNTIL THE END, because we finish the video with a non-stop walk through of the entire choreography.

If you have any questions, hit us up in the comments. We read ALL of them, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Finally ... enjoy! Now you can get your Thriller on at parties, dances or just in the middle of  the street. Share this video with your friends, family or whoever else you think might wanna learn the dance. Michael gave it to us for free, so we're just passing on the favor. It's all about spreading the love of dance!

Get ""Thriller"" on Amazon @ http://amzn.com/B0013D6LEM
It's also available on iTunes.

As always, thanks for watching and subscribing!

Action: Touch the part of the body the lyrics refer to and sing along with verses and choruses. 

""Sometimes you find small bones while you're digging. Sometimes you see big bones all connected in a museum, or sometimes by themselves. The reason why we're singing about bones is because that's the framework that keeps us together. That's why we stand straight and tall and proud and that's why we sing this song."" The toe bone's connected to the foot bone. The foot bone's connected to the ankle bone. The ankle bone's connected to the shin bone. The shin bone's connected to the knee bone. 

Chorus: We got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connections. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) 2xWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connections. The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone. The hip bone's connected to the back bone. The back bone's connected to the chest bones. Repeat Chorus

The chest bone's connected to the shoulder bone. The shoulder bone's connected to the arm bone. The arm bone's connected to the wrist bone. The wrist bone's connected to the hand bone. 

Repeat Chorus The neck bone's connected to the head bone. The head bone's connected to the nose bone. (That's cartilage!) Well, how about the ear bone. (That's cartilage too!) ""We have more parts than I thought!"" Repeat Chorus 

""That's right, you got to keep your bones real healthy and real strong. You got to make sure you get enough calcium because that's the framework of your body to stay real healthy. Keep your teeth real strong and healthy too.""

Hey everybody. So, we are going to break down the wobble dance today and if you have ever been to a BBQ, a wedding or a cruise, you will hear this, you will see this dance, you will hear this song on constant rotation about every 10 minutes. People love it. It is the new electric slide. We are going to break this down. The magic numbers are one and five. Just remember that. 

One, you are going to jump forward. Boom. Easy. Ok. Lets try that again. So we have, 5,6,7,8, jump 1. Now, when you jump here you are just going to groove, body roll, do whatever you kind of like. Any salt and pepper, onion, garlic flavor you got. So, you are going to go, 1,2,3,4, jump 5,6,7,8. 

Next part, just lean to the right, step out to the right with your right foot. Everything with the right foot. For you, it is going to look like left, for me it is my right. 5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4, other side, 5,6,7,8. Good, lets take that a little slower. So, we just jump back. 5,6,7,8, jumping out to the right. 1,2,3,4, to the left, 5,6,7,8. You have to groove, you always have to groove. You can use a little salt. So, you go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Repeat. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. 

Now, for the sauce. Some people will go up, up and cha cha cha. Up, up and cha cha cha. We are going to try mixing them up a little bit together. So, we will go up, 2, back 3, 4, now up 6 and cha cha cha. 

Now, lets try this with some music. I think you got it. [Music Plays] So, get your groove first. You want to be ready. You do not what to just start dancing from here. 5,6,7,8. 

There you have it. Through your own little flavor in it. Have a little fun. There is no limit to what you can do with the wobble dance.",kids dance learning,true

Jeff: Hey, what's up? We're going to show you how to do a dance that we call The Happy Feet. You've got to try this out. It's pretty fun. It gets a little complicated somewhere in there, but it gets fun. Check out the feet. All right, so what's going to happen is your right foot is going to be on the heel and you turn it out and then the left foot is going to be on the toe, and you turn that heel in. 

So, basically, both heels come forward, right? So when they start back again, the right foot is on the heel and the left foot is on the toe. In your mind you're thinking heel, toe, but this is a lot different than that. This is The Happy Feet, right? 

So, you're going to turn your right foot, it's going to be on the heel and you turn the toe out. Then you turn the left foot, which is going to be on the toe, you turn that heel in. So both heels come forward and you have one going out and one going in. That's what it looks like when you're standing still. It looks like this, six, seven, eight, hit, bring it back down and then you go the other way, the complete opposite of what you did before. Go. 

Now, bring it back down. Now, let's explain the other side. So, hit it and hold it. You have your left on your heel, the left went out, the right on the toe, and that came in. Again, you have both of your heels forward. Got it? Bring it down. 

Okay, so let's go to the left again. Left is on the heel, it went out. Right is on the toe, it came in. Got it? Bring it down. So let's go really slow, right and then left. Six, seven, eight, they go right side, stop. Then you go left side, stop. That's what it looks like. It gets a little complicated, but we'll do it slow one more time. Okay? 

You'll see that both of their knees are bent. So you've got to make sure you have bent knees throughout this. So they're going to go right is on the heel, left was on the toe, bring it down. You come to the left side. Left is on the heel, right is on the toe, bring it down. You got it, ladies? 

Unknown: Yeah. 

Jeff: Want to try it slow? It looks like this, six, seven, eight, they go out, down, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. In between they keep stopping. All right? So they're going to go right, stop. Left, stop. Right, stop. Left, stop. When you bend your knees it's a lot easier and it's easier to hold your balance. 

So look at their knees, watch how their knees are bent, and you have one heel, one toe. If you stay like that you're good. Let's try it. Let's speed it up a little bit. Six, seven, eight, they go out, in, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, there you go. That's Happy Feet. Got it? Let's try it to the music. Hey, Happy Feet. Hey. Hands, do whatever you want. Have a good time. Hey. Hey.",kids dance learning,true

Children everywhere love Tooty- ta!
Tooty- Ta can really help to re-focus student‚Äôs attention, get a mental and physical break from their academics  enabling them to have a better focus for learning.  Using my cool Pop version of
Tooty-Ta as a ‚Äúbrain break‚Äù is a win-win situation. Students learn during these ‚Äúbrain breaks‚Äù plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty -Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.  This version of Tooty - Ta will get your kids moving and dancing!

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My Pop version of Tooty - Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty -Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.

Check out some of our Hip-Hop dance moves which are ideal for crossing the mid-line.  It‚Äôs also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty -Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

Learn how to slow dance with this dance video from Howcast.

Loretta:  Hey everyone, what's up? my name's Loretta. This is Ava and Anthony. Today, we're going to teach you how to slow dance. Now this is something that usually happens probably at every single party that you go to, every club you go to. So this is something that you definitely want to learn how to do. 

First thing is a guy and a girl would touch each other. So placement is crucial, right? So girls hands go on the guys shoulder and the guy's hands go on her hips. Make sure it's not too low or not too high, okay?  So basic thing, step touch, step together; step together, step together, step together, awesome.

Ava:  Keep going.

Loretta:  Yeah. Now you see how it's easy. They're not too close, they're not too far and a big thing is eye contact. 

Ava:  Yes, you want to make sure you're connecting with the person that you're talking to and not looking around. Make sure that they know that you're interested and you're having a good time. 

Anthony:  Now for guys, big thing you can do when you feel like the dance is just getting a little too normal.  Simple little spin, spice it up, maybe a kiss on the hand and the last thing, a nice little dip.  

Loretta:  Oh, guys if you do that, you've got her in the palm of your hand, all right?

Ava:  All right, let's go over those moves from the top.

Loretta:  So if you do it all together. Here we go, step together; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Then Anthony can turn her, maybe give her a kiss or a dip, and then kiss her hand,  and then you're good to go. Thank you, Ava and Anthony, so that is how you slow dance with a guy.",kids dance learning,true

Lyrics:
Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
But first we‚Äôve got to catch them with our hands now
don‚Äôt you know.
Put your hands out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we‚Äôll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it‚Äôs the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should catch some and take them for a ride
But first we‚Äôve got to catch them with our nose now
don‚Äôt you know.
Put your nose out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we‚Äôll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it‚Äôs the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
But first we‚Äôve got to catch them with our lips now
don‚Äôt you know.
Put your lips out quick and hope they stick. 
Then we‚Äôll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes. 
Slip sliding, it‚Äôs the winter thing to do.

Snowflakes falling down, swirling in the sky.
we all should get some and take them for a ride.
First we‚Äôve got to catch them with our tongue now
don‚Äôt you know.
Put your tongue out quick and hope they stick.
Then we‚Äôll head out to the snow.
Slip sliding with your left foot then your right.
Slip sliding, spin around on hills of white.
Slip sliding with your boots or in your shoes.
Slip sliding, it‚Äôs the winter thing to do.
It‚Äôs the winter thing to do.
It‚Äôs the winter thing to do.

Our animated Hip- Hop Tooty Ta song  is super popular children‚Äôs song and dance. Students get some fun physical activity,while they rejuvenate their body and brain. Children everywhere love Tooty ta! Tooty Ta is a growing pattern, repeat after me song and dance.

Tooty Ta can really help to re-focus student‚Äôs attention, giving them a mental and physical break from their academics. This  enables them to have a better focus for learning. 
 Tooty-Ta as a ‚Äúbrain break‚Äù is a win-win situation. Students learn during these ‚Äúbrain breaks‚Äù plus return to a task renewed and energized.

Classroom and Physical Education teachers as well as home learners can quickly and easily use Tooty Ta to give students fun and energizing brain breaks.

It is important that our children get opportunities throughout the day for movement. My  Tooty Ta has a cool contemporary beat that kids today really love.  Of all the Tooty Ta songs out there, children and teachers all over the country and the world love my version.
It‚Äôs also important for your children to hear the alliteration of Tooty Ta to develop their phonological awareness for listening to the sounds in our language.

HEY EVERYBODY!! My family and I wanted to play a fun new game! It's kind of like charades but we are writing down really funny ideas where animals are doing something crazy! Here are some of the crazy prompts we made - Frog jumping on a Trampoline, Monkeys doing pushups, Crabs doing a Dab, a rock jumping, and a sloth doing the floss!! When I got the prompt with the sloth my dad said he had a surprise for me and sneaked away to grab something! He came back in a full costume dressed as Fifi the Sloth!! It was so funny to see him like that! He then snuck away again and brought back some Fifi the Dancing Sloth toys!! We got them out of their box and danced with them!! It was so fun!! #ad

I've really made this as BEGINNER-FRIENDLY as possible, so you should be able to do it with this EASY tutorial! üòúBIG THANKS to Brian Esperon (@besperon) for this awesome TikTok dance!

PS. I know that there is another version out there to the Megan Thee Stallion part of the WAP song, but this is the Cardi B part where she goes:
""Now from the top, make it drop, that's so wet that's so wet
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's so wet that's so wet
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's so wet that's so wet
Macaroni in a pot, that's so wet that's so wet""

I'm so happy that this WAP dance is done to a ""clean"" part, or else I probably wouldn't have made this tutorial üòú

Btw, did you know that Cardi B has done this TikTok dance as well? Yup, that's how awesome this dance is. Now we just need all the TikTok stars to do it as well (obviously Charli won't because Heidi won't let her, haha, and I totally understand!)

ZIGALOO LYRICS 

Oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Zigaloo, Zigaloo

I have a little friend
Who would like to dance with you,
It‚Äôs a funny little dino
And his name is Zigaloo.

Oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Zigaloo, Zigaloo.
Oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Zigaloo, Zigaloo.

Lift your leg and
then put your arm up,
Shake your head
And start to hop-hop!

One step forward
One to the side ‚Äì and
Shake your hand,
And jump one time, yes.

Do a little twirl and
Move really funky,
Scratch your head
Just like a monkey.

Walk like a penguin
And touch your nose,
Do a little wink,
Now stop and pose.

Raise your eyebrows,
Make a funny face, then
Move like an astronaut
In space, and ‚Äì

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Zigaloo, Zigaloo

On your toes
Just like a giraffe,
Leap like a frog
And start to laugh, yes.

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Zigaloo
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Zigaloo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Zigaloo, Zigaloo

‚òÖ Lyrics
We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A ghostly, ghoulish goblin waving cheerfully. 
He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A very vain vampire waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.
SOUND EFFECT- Door closing to a slam!

Or do you lack confidence to try it in front of other people? In this Beginner Bhangra tutorial, I have put together my top three beginner Bhangra steps that you can try in the comfort of your own home. Dance like no one's watching... literally :-)

We will learn the following steps in this Bhangra tutorial: 
Dhamaal
Bedi
Punjab 

I have broken these steps down into upper and lower body movements in an easy and follow-along format. Just find a comfortable space and follow the counts with me. Practice as many times as you need to, before trying each step out with music.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to use these steps in a basic Bhangra choreogrpahy on G. Sidhu's ""Candlelight"", one of my favorite songs of 2018. Hopefully, this will give you more confidence to dance at the next Bhangra party or wedding. If you like this tutorial and would like to learn more steps, let me know in the comments section below. I hope you enjoy dancing with me.

Learn Bharatanatyam | Natya Vardhini (Adavus, Alarippu and Jatiswaram) - 

Bharatanatyam being the oldest and purest form of indian classical dance is a combination of music, expression and rhythm. the two facets of indian dance, the Tandava (vigorous) and the Lasya (gentle), blend beautifully in Bharathanatyam. It encompasses all the elements of dance, drama and spiritually elevates the audience. Bharatanatyam is poetry in motion and all the cognate elements of Bhava, Raga and Tala reveal themselves as all in one.

Srekala Bharath - 
A disciple of renowned Guru K J Sarasa, Srekala Bharath is a passionate dancer, an ingenious choreographer and an inspirational teacher. Srekala started dancing her way into the hearts and minds of rasikas at the tender age of seven with her inimitable style, nimble footwork and exquisite abhinaya. Srekala has created thematic presentations ranging from traditional classics to modern day concepts. All of these have received critical acclaim including the Kalaimamani, Tamilnadu state award, and the Bharata Rathnam from the Government of Sri Lanka. 

Srekala is deeply committed to the exceptional development of her students enabling them to evolve as artistes as they share in her creative journey at 'Thejas', an institution she founded that defines talent and continues to empower artistic expression in Chennai, India for over a decade.

Here we present you a world where in you may master the exquisite art form in easy, simple steps.

Uma, still resentful over not being selected by Ben to go to Auradon with the other Villain Kids, stirs her pirate gang including Captain Hook's son Harry and Gaston's son Gil, to break the barrier between the Isle of the Lost and Auradon, and unleash all the villains imprisoned on the Isle, once and for all.

He was called 'The Phoenix of Indian Cinema'. He made his debut in the 1972 film, Vamsha Vriksha, in a supporting role. The same year he played the lead role in Puttanna Kanagal's Naagarahaavu, and was recognized as the Angry young man of Kannada cinema. He has played a variety of roles in different genres. 
. 
Vishnuvardhan was born in Mysore to H. L. Narayana Rao and Kamakshamma. His ancestors are from Hallegere, Mandya district of Karnataka. His father was an artist, music composer and a scriptwriter who was known for his collection of musical instruments. His sister Rama was a Kathak dancer at the Mysore Palace. He had six siblings. He was educated first in Mysore's Gopalswamy School and then at Bangalore's Kannada Model High School. He attended high school and obtained a degree from National College, Basavanagudi, Bangalore
Vishnuvardhan married actress Bharathi on 17 February 1975 in Bangalore. They have adopted two children, Keerthi and Chandana. Vishnuvardhan started his career with the National Award-winning movie Vamshavruksha (1972) directed by Girish Karnad based on the novel written by S. L. Bhyrappa. His first lead role was in Naagarahaavu, directed by Puttanna Kanagal and based on a novel by T. R. Subba Rao. It was the first in Kannada film history to complete 100 days in three main theatres of Bangalore. In his 35-year career, he has played a variety of roles in more than 200 films. 

S. P. Balasubrahmanyam is record-holder for having sung more than 40,000 songs in Indian languages including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi. SPB's voice suited Vishnuvardhan, and people felt it was a perfect combination. He started singing for Vishnuvardhan in the 1972 film Naagarahaavu. Vishnuvardhan never missed any of the birthdays of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. In every film of the actor, he had to sing couple of songs and Vishnu would insist. Balasubrahmanyam has sung all the five songs in his last Kannada film. Aptharakshaka and was awarded the Best Playback Singer Filmfare Award for the song Gharane Ghara Gharane. He dedicated his award to Vishnuvardhan. After Vishnuvardhan's death, Balasubrahmanyam paid tribute to him in musical nights and one such show happened in Bengaluru and Mysuru.

He started singing in movies occasionally and later went on to singing devotional songs for albums. The first song he sang was in the movie Nagarahole and he has recorded some duet songs with the notable legendary singers S. Janaki and P. Susheela. The first devotional album sung by him was on Lord Ayappa and the title of the album was Jyothiroopa Ayappa. His other albums were ""Thayi Bhanashankari"" (on goddess Banashankari) and Vishwapremi Ayappa. He also sang devotional songs on Dharmastala's Lord Manjunathaswamy, Malemadeshwara and Ranachandi Chamundi

Product Info: 
Kids can get up and dance with BeatBo when they play with the Bright Beats Learning Lights Dance Mat. Last year‚Äôs BeatBo was a toy robot that played music and danced, encouraging babies and toddlers to dance along with him. Now BeatBo is back but with an interactive dance mat for even more dancing and learning fun. 

The centerpiece of the soft Learning Lights Dance Mat is the BeatBo character in the center of the mat. This BeatBo has motion sensors on its front and back to know where babies are moving as they dance around the mat. When BeatBo senses a child‚Äôs motion, it will play music, phrases, and a light show. Babies can also press any of the four buttons on BeatBo‚Äôs base for more lights, songs, and phrases. Unlike the original BeatBo, the BeatBo on this dance mat doesn‚Äôt dance and move, but babies can bat at BeatBo to make him spin around.

There are two modes of play with the Dance Mat. In Move & Play mode, there are music, phrases, and lights to encourage baby to get moving and introduce them to colors. For instance, when babies press any of the four buttons on the base, they‚Äôll hear BeatBo say the color of the button, ask kids to find a color, or hear fun dance-along songs. And in Dance & Learn mode, babies will hear songs and play games about ABCs, numbers one through 10, shapes, and colors.

Learn you dance ABC's with Sarahndipity in the lyrical children's book, From A-Z: Animals Get Funky!

 From A-Z: Animals Get Funky! is a groovy dance book and album with vivid animal illustrations and playful lyrics teaching dance movements, confidence, inclusion, creativity and unique expression. 

This book was inspired by Anne Green Gilbert's Dance Concepts, and modern dance pioneer Rudolf von Laban's work. With their inspiration, Sarahndipity carefully crafted a dance book that engages the cerebral cortex through form, force, time, movement, space, and body. 

It's Fun for the Mind, Spirit, and Body!

After playing with the dances in this book, children of all ages can:

    Feel more confident in creative play
    Develop social skills
    Practice balance
    Experience less stress
    Express their uniqueness
    Playfully exercise
    Boost serotonin levels
    Support brain cognition and development of the cerebral cortex
    Hydrate and celebrate a healthy life

""You are not alone in your desire to support a healthy future. While obtaining my Master's Degree in Education, I was blessed to learn amazing curriculum in creative arts and gained valuable insights into how to support all learning styles through creative arts. 

Let's join together in celebration through dance and music as we honor our future, ourselves, our families, and our precious bodies.""
Love,
Sarahndipity

In each episode of ‚ÄúThe Blossom Shoppe‚Äù, join Poppy & Posie at the Blossom Shoppe, an inclusive and accepting place where children from around the world are welcomed to learn, grow, and blossom together! Poppy & Posie's fun and educational kids' videos inspire creativity, kindness, and confidence! From telling stories, to singing and dancing, to fun games as well as DIY kids' activities, Poppy & Posie's videos are both entertaining and enriching, touching upon meaningful lessons and topics in a new way,  designed to encourage positive growth and development in their blossoming viewers. Children are invited to take part in each conversation by submitting videos of themselves to be featured in the episode.

Poppy & Posie Blossom are the beloved main characters of the award-winning picture book, ""The Blossom Shoppe,"" which was published under The Blossom Company -- the children‚Äôs book publishing and media company where stories truly come off the page through storybook character videos and live events as well as through fun and enriching book-inspired products to promote creativity and a love of reading.

Through the unique combination of literature and storybook character videos for kids and events along with book-inspired products and activities (crafts, coloring pages, DIY kits, music albums, costumes, and more), The Blossom Company hopes to inspire children to become active and passionate readers, to encourage children to connect what they read to the world around them, and last but not least, to make sure that each and every child knows exactly how BLOSSOM they are!

Driven by a love of creating enriching and inspiring content for children, The Blossom Company was co-founded by Caroline & Katherine Brickley, 22-year-old twin sisters, during their freshman year of college. Caroline & Katherine perform as Poppy and Posie in their internationally-acclaimed YouTube show and they are so happy and humbled to be a part of the kind and welcoming worldwide community the show has fostered.

The Blossom Company is dedicated to and inspired by its mission statement:

‚ÄúWe exist to bridge the gap between literature and life, to cultivate creativity, understanding, and acceptance, and to encourage all children to blossom together.‚Äù

Dancing Star can be compared to the hugely popular Cha Cha Slide. Children follow directions and move together.

You can use brain breaks to start your day, anytime children need a positive physical activity, after lunch or for indoor recess on days with bad weather.

When I perform any of my brain breaks songs in concert, children love it. Dancing Star is no exception.

My brain breaks songs can be used in physical education classes too. Teachers love how the children have to stop and put their hands to their ears to listen carefully. This is a great song to teach children about following directions.
Dancing Star Words and Music by Jack Hartmann, copyright 2011 Jack Hartmann www.jackhartmann.com 

LYRICS:

Dancing Star
 
Watch me, watch me I can raise the roof 
Watch me, watch me I can shake it loose  Chorus 
Shake it down then jump it up so far
I can shine like a dancing star 
 
Let‚Äôs get loose and warm it up 
All together, step to the front
 Jump to the back and clap 
Raise your arms up in the air 
Back and forth like you just don‚Äôt care
 Right leg stomp to the left
 Left leg stomp to the right 
One arm up shake your hips 
I can disco just like this Now stop and pose 
Be cool, slide to the right 
Be cool, slide to the left Jump up and count 
 
Robo dance, move it, block it like a robot You got it 
 
(Chorus) 
 
 
Now everybody square it up 
Step to the back, slide to the right 
Step to the front, slide to the left 
Now cabbage patch, arms circle around, be cool get down
 Country dance, stomp and clap 
Now turn around, clap like this 
Turn around again, clap like this 
Right leg stomp to the left, left leg stomp to the right 
Now jump up, criss-cross, criss-cross 
Shake your shoulders, shake your hips 
Shake it like a salt shaker, like this
 Now turn around, clap like this 
Turn around again, clap like this 
your own dance, dance free
 Now freeze Let‚Äôs cool it down, do the sprinkler 
Take it down, that was fun, we‚Äôre done

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) shows Sara (Julia Stiles) how to dance to hip-hop music.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In this romantic drama, two teenagers in love struggle to look past their differences. After the unexpected death of her mother, Sarah Johnson (Julia Stiles) moves to Chicago to live with her father. Knowing no one at her new school and not at home in a gritty, inner-city high school, Sarah has trouble adjusting, but she soon becomes friends with Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), who has talent and street smarts but a checkered past. Sarah was an avid student of ballet before her mother's death sidelined her studies, while Derek has some serious hip-hop moves, and their mutual love of dance leads their friendship into something deeper. However, since Sarah is white and Derek is black, they have more to contend with than the average high school couple; Sarah gets static from Nikki (Bianca Lawson), Derek's former girlfriend, while Derek has to deal with his friend Malakai (Fredro Starr), who is still deep in the thug life Derek is trying to avoid. Save the Last Dance was directed by Thomas Carter, who previously examined the sociopolitical side of dancing in Swing Kids.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

This dance form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathakars or storytellers. Its form today contains traces of temple and ritual dances, and the influence of the bhakti movement. From the 16th century onwards it absorbed certain features of Persian dance and central Asian dance which were imported by the royal courts of the Mughal era. The name Kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word katha meaning story, and katthaka in Sanskrit means he who tells a story, or to do with stories. The name of the form is properly ‡§ï‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§ï katthak, with the geminated dental to show a derived form, but this has since simplified to modern-day ‡§ï‡§•‡§ï kathak. kathaa kahe so kathak is a saying many teachers pass on to their pupils, which is generally translated, she/he who tells a story, is a kathak', but which can also be translated, 'that which tells a story, that is 'Kathak'.

There is one ""Muse-Spot"" (a sticker on the ground) in the center. When the game leader calls for a ""Switch"" the current lead dancer leaves the center and whoever gets to he center-spot fastest is the next Muse (dance leader). In this game the children are learning several things. One is to overcome their shyness and assert themselves by competing for the Muse-spot. Another is to mind others, not to bully and push but to be gentle in the process. It's important to discuss this at the start of the game. You can JUMP for a second time, but only if there is not another dancer who has not gone before. So we learn to look out for and encourage each other. Then when we get to the center we learn leadership by offering our movement ideas to the group as we practice our creativity by pulling fun dancing ideas out of thin air.

To date there are 18 MUVE Dancing Games explained and demonstrated at http://www.muve.org/muve-dancing-games/ . MUVE school dance exercises are so much fun to do, that the kids don't even realize that they are exercising. 

MUVE is a free resource for children, adults and seniors. Learn about all the free healthy dance activity games and dance exercise videos, the MUVE Dancing Game instructions and the MUVE School Dance Curriculum (CSPAP - Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program) at our website http://www.MUVE.org",kids dance learning,false

Dancing Robots
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
DANCING ROBOTS 3:57
Directions: This a dance where you imitate a dancing robot. It is performed with small jerks to give the impression of motors 
starting and stopping. Keep your posture stiff at all times. When you are directed to stop, stay as motionless as possible. During
the malfunction imitate a 'broken robot', slowly bend at your waist and then powering up again . The dance concludes with the
'broken robot'. Using exaggerated jerking motions and a look of confusion on your face as you drop towards the ground give the
impression that the robot has completely ceased to function.

Robot: ""Tummy in, shoulders back""
Refrain:
Robots stand still. We'll stand up straight not moving.
We'll move then stop. It's hard to bend that steel.
We're stiff and straight with every little motion.
We're just machines but we certainly look real.
Raise your right hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Raise your left hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. (2X)
Now turn your head to the right a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head to the left a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. (2X)
Robot: ""Stop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a
grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.""
1,2,3,4
Repeat Refrain
Raise your right leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop
Raise your left leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop CONTINUED NEXT PAGE
Now lower that leg down a little bit ...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop

‚òÖ Lyrics
We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A ghostly, ghoulish goblin waving cheerfully. 
He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.

We tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? 
A very vain vampire waving cheerfully. 
 He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye
And then we started dancing much to our surprise.
We started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.
And then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. 
And he hopped and shouted FREEZE!
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.
Tip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.

Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh.
Come on everybody, girls and boys let‚Äôs smile and make some happy noise.
Let‚Äôs all sing our Jamaican song. Jump right in and swim, and sing along.
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea! Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea!
Reach your arms up towards the island sun. Sway them like a palm tree, sing and
have fun.
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea! Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea!
Shake your maracas like maracas shakers do.
Shimmy your shoulders and sing this happy tune.

Shake your bodies up and shake your bodies down.
Keep shaking side to side to these very happy sounds.
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea! Away, Away,
Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea!
Hands on your waist, move your knees out and in.
Keep moving them while we all sing.
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea! Away, Away,
Away, Away, Oh. Oh, Yea!
Now, we all know the Jamaican song. Feel the heat
under your feet and let‚Äôs all sing along.
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Ouch! Away, Away, Ouch!
Away, Away, Oh, Ooh, that‚Äôs hot
Away, Away, Away, Away, Oh. Ouch, ooh, etc.

Lyrics:
Robot: ‚ÄúTummy in, shoulders back‚Äù
Robots stand still. We‚Äôll stand up straight not moving.       
We‚Äôll move then stop. It‚Äôs hard to bend that steel.    
We‚Äôre stiff and straight with every little motion.  
We‚Äôre just machines but we certainly look real. 

Raise your right hand up a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    
Now lower that hand down a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    

Raise your left hand up a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    
Now lower that hand down a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    
I‚Äôm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. 
I‚Äôm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. 

Now turn your head to the right a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop   
Now turn your head back just a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    

Now turn your head to the left a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop   
Now turn your head back just a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more‚Ä¶stop    
I‚Äôm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. 
I‚Äôm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms.  

Robot: ‚ÄúStop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.‚Äù 1,2,3,4 

Robots stand still. We‚Äôll stand up straight not moving.       
We‚Äôll move then stop. It‚Äôs hard to bend that steel.    
We‚Äôre stiff and straight with every little motion.  
We‚Äôre just machines but we certainly look real. 

Raise your right leg up a little bit‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more ‚Ä¶stop    
Now lower that leg down a little bit ‚Ä¶stop, 
A little more‚Ä¶stop, A little more ‚Ä¶stop

And point your toes. 
Now say gobble, gobble, gobble. (Gobble, gobble, gobble.)

And we‚Äôre proud of how we moved. (Bow)
It was so much fun, we don‚Äôt want to be done. (Thumbs up and then shake pointer finger)
So, let‚Äôs give it one more groove. (Hold your palms up)

Repeat Chorus (and change last line)
Step side to side, reach high and low. 
Wiggle your shoulders
And make a pose. (Freeze in place momentarily for a photograph)
(Repeat) Side to side, high and low. 
Shake your feathers (Wiggle your shoulders and whole body)
And point your toes. 
Now say gobble, gobble, gobble. (Gobble, gobble, gobble.)
And a strut, strut, strut. (And a strut, strut, strut.)
Do a wobble, wobble, wobble. (Wobble, wobble, wobble.)
Then we all just said, ‚ÄúGood Luck!‚Äù (Hold your fist up)

Nursery Rhyme Dance
From the CD, ""#1 Best Kid's Songs!""
by The Learning Station
‚Ñó¬© Monopoli/The Learning Station

Lyrics:

(Free dance during the Refrains. During the Choruses Don sings the directions he wants you to follow. As each new nursery rhyme 
character is introduced, pretend to play their instrument. (guitar, bugle and drums) Replace Humpty Dumpty in refrains with 
underlined characters.)

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King's horses, and all the King's men, couldn't put Humpty together again!

Refrain: Now, you might think that it's the end to this rhyme...but Humpty Dumpty had something in mind. He got back together with Little Bo Beep and they began to dance to this funky dance beat! 

Chorus: Bust a move, dance with your feet, put your hands in the air and sing, 
ahhh eee ahh eee. Move your feet, put your arms out to the side, 
move them up and down and sing i ee i 

Old King Cole was a merry old sole. A merry old sole was he. He grabbed his guitar, 
just like a rock star and jammed with his fiddlers three. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 
Little Boy Blue came to blow his horn, the best bugle blower around. He blew and he blew, that's what he liked to do, he really knew how to get down. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 
Little Jack Horner jumped out of his corner and put away his Christmas pie. He stuck in his thumb and pulled out a drum and played it till the time flew by. Repeat Refrain and Chorus 2x

Tony Chestnut (Toe Knee Chest Nut) Lyrics and Movements:
Tony Chestnut knows I love you.   (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) 
Tony knows.  Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) 
Tony Chestnut knows I love you. (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) 
That's what Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.)                                                          
Tony, Tony and his sister Eileen.  (Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)
And Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)
But Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)
And there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) 
This song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)
How it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)
And guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.)

Why take brain breaks?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
‚Ä¢ refresh
‚Ä¢ recharge
‚Ä¢ refocus
‚Ä¢ regenerate
‚Ä¢ release stress
‚Ä¢ breathe
Regular brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing children to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  
C'MON LET'S DANCE is a great brain breaks action, dance song to make it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh then they can return to their academics feeling happy, joyous, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realizing the significant values of brain breaks for both students and teachers. So take a break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. In the classroom this brain breaks dance song is perfect for the preschool and kindergarten.

C'MON LET'S DANCE
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
C'MON LET'S DANCE 3:11
This song contains a collection of Fad, Craze or Novelty style dances. Dance style fads have always been a part of social dancing.
Now it's your turn to be creative, get silly, have fun and make-up your very own movement for each dance that Deejay Don calls
out.
Chorus:
C'mon let's dance. There's so many dances we can't count them all.
C'mon let's dance. We'll make up our own and we'll have a ball.
Do The Peek-a-boo, do The Karate Monkey, do The Tickle Yourself,
Now, Tip Toe Through The Tulips. Repeat Chorus
Do the Jiggling Jell-O, do the Frankenstein Monster Walk,
Now, do The Milkshake, now do The Bunny Hop.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Hula Hoop, do The Popping Popcorn,
Now, do The Chicken Little, now do The Leap Frog.
Now do The Tie Yourself In A Knot, do The Q-tip, The Cat's Got Your Tongue,
now do The Spin, do The Falling Leaf, do The Cell Phone.
(The following is an actual conversation from On Star)
Phone rings: Hello -- Hello, yea, I'd like to order a couple pizzas. Uh, no this not a pizza place. What is it then? We're doing a
song here. The C'mon Let's Dance.? Yea, yea, that's the song. By The Learning Station? Exactly. How's it go? It goes...
Repeat Chorus
Do The Stretch, do The Windshield Wiper, the Mosquito Bite, now do The Hopscotch.
Repeat Chorus
Do The Slip And Slide, do The Helicopter, do The Sprinkler, now do The Toaster.
Repeat Chorus (3X)

Dinosaur Stomp by Koo Koo Kanga Roo Copyright 2017

Lyrics:
Pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it 

I am a stegosaurus 
call me a brontosaurus 
I'll get you with my taurus 
hey hey hey hey 
Way down Jurassic Park 
Hanging out after dark 
Im scary like a shark 
hey hey hey hey 
I hang with little foot 
he gives me great input 
we eat at pizza hut 
hey hey hey hey 
I am a dinosaur 
most of us like to roar 
roam jungles and explore 

Pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it 

Tyrannosaurus rex 
smashing all your objects 
ill put you in a hex 
hey hey hey hey 
I‚Äôm in the jungle roaring 
but when it gets too boring 
I go a carnivoring 
hey hey hey hey 
velociraptor name 
eating meat is my game 
extinction I became 
hey hey hey hey 
swoop - there goes a pterodactyl 
nothing rhymes pterodactyl 
I just like pterodactyls 
hey hey hey hey 

Pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
pick up your foot and stomp it, stomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it 
open up your jaws and chomp it chomp it",kids dance learning,true

Children will learn the moves to this fun Hip Hop dance song! 

Hip Hop (Fast) is a great brain breaks action, dance song for children. It makes it easy and fun to take a quick energy break.  When children take a moment to sing, dance and move then they can return to their academics feeling happy, energized and renewed. So take a brain break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. 

Why children should take brain breaks in the classroom?
Brain breaks allow children the opportunity mentally rest their brain by diverting their mind into movements that allow them to:
‚Ä¢ refresh
‚Ä¢ recharge
‚Ä¢ refocus
‚Ä¢ regenerate
‚Ä¢ release stress
‚Ä¢ breathe
Regular children's classroom brain breaks enhance attentiveness, concentration, focus and accelerate learning by allowing them to release their energy, anxiety and stress.  Brain breaks in the classroom also increase circulation and promote physical fitness and coordination.  This brain breaks children's dance song is great for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age children. This song is also ideal for indoor recess, group activities and physical education.

Hip Hop (Fast)
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 

LYRICS:
I'm hip hop Don with street clothes on. I'm here to show you whereupon,
I say, you listen, we go. We'll start off slow.
Palms down, the points of your fingers face each other.
Lift up and push down. That's good let's do another.
This time when you lift, your knee follows your hands.
Just like a puppet string, it moves at your command.
Right knee Up, down (4x) left knee Up, down (4x)

Chorus:
Keep doing it, you got that right.
This hip hop stuff is out of sight.
And now let's try a brand new thing.
In a while, right now let's sing.
H to the I, I to the P that's hip; H to the O, O to the P that's hop. It's hip hop.

Fan with your hands, cool down your face.
Keep doing this and keep the pace.
Take giant steps to the right and left.
Now back up and retrace your steps and stop.

Chorus

Point your toes first in then out.
And that will move you all about.
Now raise your arms. Swing them around
Side to side, up and down, now stop.

Chorus

Stand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat.
Now bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat.
Add your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat.
Make your way back up, that move is complete.

Chorus

Hands on your knees now jump real small. It looks just like your sliding.
Jump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and
Use your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!
A ""Y"" hand means whatever, and an open hand means STOP!

Chorus

The Penguin Dance uses a growing pattern to teach left and right, following directions, listening skills and develops gross motor movement skills.  We mirror left and right sides to make it easy to follow.  

Brain research suggests that physical activity like engaging in my fun movements songs like Penguin Dance, increases a student‚Äôs ability to process and retain new material.

I think brain breaks should be fun! Parent, teachers and kids all love the Penguin Dance.

Brain Breaks including songs like the Penguin Dance help your children rejuvenate and re-focus on learning.

The Penguin Dance is on my Get on Board the Transition Train album.
