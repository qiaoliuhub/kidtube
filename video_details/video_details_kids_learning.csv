This is a fun and informative video that teaches children and kids about chickens.  Chickens are farm yard animals that children can easily recognize.   Chickens lay eggs which kids already know about.  They make the familiar ""cluck, cluck"" sound that toddlers and young kids like to say when mimicking animal sounds.

Lyrics:

Hello I‚Äôm your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

As a baby you start out 
with about 300 different bones
That's a lot considering many fuse  
when you are grown
206 bones is what 
you have as an adult
Do to all the fusion
your bones do this is the result
Ligaments hold the ends 
of your bones together this is true
And Muscles attach to bone
with Tendons connective tissue 
Tendons and Ligaments connect 
to bones on either side of a joint
Holding bones together tightly
That is the point
Bone Marrow‚Äôs a soft and spongy tissue 
found inside some bones
Bone Morrow Stroma Stem Cells are called 
Mesenchymal 
Mesenchymal Stem cells are the two colors 
Yellow and Red
The yellow color produces fat, bone 
and your cartilage 
The Red color produces white and 
red blood cells 
It also makes the Platelets that cause clotting
to stop bleeding well

Hello I‚Äôm your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here‚Äôs some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

Let's focus on some of the major bones
in the human body
We‚Äôll start at the top of the cranium
which is called your Skull you see
Then we‚Äôll move down to your 
Mandible it helps you chew food 
Onto the Clavicle also called The
Collarbone on you
Here we have the Sternum
Which connects all your Ribs
Here‚Äôs the Pelvis it‚Äôs your midsection
which gives you your hips
Connected to your Pelvis is the 
biggest bone in the body
It‚Äôs called the Femur and it is also 
the strongest bone you‚Äôll see
Right below are the Tibia and the Fibula
on you
They work together to hold your feet on
your body this is true 
Let's not forget that Humerus 
Bone on the upper arm
It‚Äôs attached to the Radius and Ulna
that form your forearm 
Your hand is made up of about
27 bones
We‚Äôll focus on those in another one of my 
songs catchy tones

Hello I‚Äôm your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body    

Let's move to the Posterior
or the backside of you
The first thing you‚Äôll notice is the 
Spinal Column I'll break that down too
The Cervical Vertebrae 
also known as your neck
Is made up of 7 bones
to help keep your head in check
Then the Thoracic Vertebrae 
Is made up of 12 bones
It‚Äôs the longest stretch of your 
the spinal column that is shown
Then there's the Lumbar Vertebrae
on your lower back
It‚Äôs an arch and a very 
important bony stack
Onto your Sacrum, it's attached
to your Pelvis
Then the spine ends with the fusion of bones 
called the Coccyx 
Please take care of your bones 
and keep them healthy and strong
They give you the structure in your life 
to help you live really long

Hello I‚Äôm your skeleton 
as you can plainly see
Here are some of the 206 bones 
in the human body

Snakes are reptiles that can be found all over the world (except for Antarctica, which is too cold). Some snakes even live in the ocean! Although many people are frightened by snakes, most snakes are not dangerous to humans and they have remarkable abilities such as unhinging their jaw to swallow food whole and smelling with their tongue. Snakes are cool!

Hello everyone!!!It‚Äôs me again ‚Äì Handy-Andy!!!! Let‚Äôs continue our winter holidays! The weather is great ‚Äì so I‚Äôve decided to go skating. Ohhhh!!!!My car is running out of gasoline‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..veeery fast!!!! Look at the arrow on the fuel gauge is lower the red line ‚Äì it means that we have a little bit gasoline left in a tank! What should I do??!!The nearest gas station is not so close‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..hmmmm! it‚Äôs much easier for the trolleybus ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt need gasoline, it uses electricity.  
So! What are we going to do?!I‚Äôll phone my friend and ask him to tow my car to the nearest gas station. ‚ÄúHi my friend!! I need your help! I ran out of gasoline! Cold you tow me to the gas station near here, please?? The road sign shows that in a 700 meters it‚Äôs going to be gas station, so it‚Äôs not far! Are you coming soon? I‚Äôm really waiting for you! Thanks in advance!!!‚ÄùReal friend are always ready to help, doesn‚Äôt matter where they are!!!
I‚Äôm lucky that my friend lives not far from here, and he can come fast! Hooray!!!I can hear his motor!!!Brrrrrrr. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs him!!!!! Lamborgini is a racing car ‚Äì for sure!!!
Hooray!!!My friend is here!!!!To tow my car we need a special towrope ‚Äì one end we should attach to the front of my car and the other end to Lamborgini. Now I‚Äôm on a tow and and my friend‚Äôs car is a tow truck! It‚Äôs good that the gas station is not so far. To be on a tow is not a fun!))))))
Here we go!!!Gas station!!!Thanks my dear friend for your help!!!!Now we have to unhook the towrope and my friend can go!!!!!I‚Äôm going to fill in the fuel tank and continue my trip! 
So!!! We should open the tank and attach the filling valve. It‚Äôs also called the fuel gun! The fuel gauge needle (arrow) shows how the tank is filled. Can you hear the sound????The gasoline is coming under the pressure from the station tank to the tank in the car. Great!!!The tank is full now! Let‚Äôs put the fuel gun back and close the tank. We are ready to go now! 
Wow wowwow! Look the gasoline tanker is coming to the station!!!!! Gasoline tanker - it‚Äôs a truck that transfers fuel to the gas stations. It has very big tank for fuel! Have you ever thought how the fuel goes to the station and where it is stored!? Gasoline tanker takes the fuel to the station, then the fuel goes to the underground metal tanks through special pipes, and it is stored there. These metal tanks are connected to the station tanks, which we use to fuel our cars. 
So, my tank is full‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..let‚Äôs continue our trip. Today we also had adventure)))))) But it‚Äôs good that we saw gasoline tanker and learned about fuel on the gas stations. It was interesting!!!!Hooray!!!
I will keep going my friends! Goodbye!!!!!Beep! Beep!

Brain Breaks
From the CD, Brain Boogie Boosters
by The Learning Station and Dr. Becky Bailey                                                                                                                                                
‚Ñó¬© Monopoli, Bailey/The Learning Station
LYRICS:
[Chorus]: Brain breaks, got to take them now and then.
Brain breaks, we take them on a whim.
Brain breaks, give our mind a rest.
Brain breaks, so we can be our best.
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate.
Cross it left, and cross it right.
Because it works both day and night.
Crisscross, it makes my brain a better boss. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. With my arms I make a figure 8.
This helps my brain communicate. Figure 8's, learning's great with figure 8's. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. Feet apart, hands on your knees.
Cross your shoulders, helps fatigue. Spinal twist, it goes like this, spinal twist. (2x)
[Repeat Chorus]
Rev it up to activate. Bring it down to negotiate. Rub your ears, unfold the flaps.
Listening, becomes a snap. Rub your ears. It helps us hear the music. Rub your ears. (2x)
Time now to get back on task. Wave to a friend, this feeling can last.
Find your seat, or sit where you are. Slowly, calmly, be a star.

#Dinosaur #KidsGames #Buildingblocks #Blockbuilding #Decoration #Story #Police #Castle #Pirate #Treehouse #Hospital #Firestation
üöÄ Episode 1: https://youtu.be/2vOmZyAf_IY

‚Ä¢ With 791 creative building blocks, children can create a wide variety of designs!
Decorative elements keep play dynamic, including elaborate windows and doors, intricate roof designs, cool blocks, and more! As children craft their block kingdom, they discover countless innovative details. The storylines and characters that support each building theme make every play session a surprising experience. 

‚Ä¢ Discover 6 different themes, each containing 4 unique architectural styles!
For example, in the Castle Theme, children create a sparkling ice palace for the princess, or they might choose to assemble a mystical castle that brings magic to life! Children can also build a royal palace with gorgeous domes and tower-shaped blocks. They might even stack a fairy-castle using pink garden-themed blocks!

‚Ä¢ Inspired and imaginative plots and animations!
Within the Police Station theme, children build city police stations, mountain police stations, jails, and more. Equipped with satellite dishes, monitoring room, helipad roof, sirens, and more, stacking these blocks triggers fun animations! Drag out a prison block and watch a thrilling jailbreak unfold! Numerous rich details give children plenty to explore.

‚Ä¢ 19 playable characters mean role-playing offers endless fun!
Different dinosaurs live within various themes. Interact with dinosaur police, firefighters, wizards, pirates, princesses, doctors, and more! What mischief will take place once these dinosaur residents join the cities your child creates?

Create freely in this building block world without limits! Come on, let‚Äôs become a little architect!

Firstly, if newspapers disappeared, many people may start missing their daily morning routine of reading a newspaper while having a hot cup of tea or coffee.
Secondly, if newspapers disappeared, millions of people may remain unaware of important events happening in their city or in the world.
Thirdly, if newspapers disappeared, consumption of news related apps or websites may skyrocket.
Fourthly, if newspapers disappeared, people who pay but never actually read a newspaper will start saving some money.
Fifthly, if newspapers disappeared, people who are used to reading news on their smart-phones or computers may not even notice their disappearance.
Lastly, if newspapers disappeared, soybean farmers will be disappointed as soy ink is commonly used while printing newspaper.

*Lyrics*
-----------------------------------------
Hello, my name is Prince Valin,
and you stole my book.
Prepare to play along.
I'm looking for a five-fingered princess.

Little princess song,
little princess song.
It's the little princess song.

Little princess,
wearing a tiara,
knowing that you are a
princess of the realm;

Little princess,
in your gown of blue,
you know just what to do.
You smile. (Smile!)

Little princess,
wearing a tiara,
knowing that you are a
princess of the realm;

Little princess,
in your gown of yellow,
you're looking for your fellow.
You smile, (Smile!)
and wave. (Wave!)

Little princess, 
wearing a tiara,
knowing that you are a
princess of the realm;

Little princess,
in your gown of pink,
you know just what to think.
You smile, (Smile!)
and wave, (Wave!)
and curtsy. (Curtsy!)

Where is your prince,
your handsome, handsome prince?
Oh, where can he be? (Inconceivable!)

There is your prince,
your handsome, handsome prince!
Happy you will be!

Little princess,
wearing a tiara,
knowing that you are a 
princess of the realm;

Little princess,
in your gown of red,
tiara on your head,
you smile, (Smile!)
and wave, (Wave!)
and curtsy, (Curtsy!)
and dance. (Dance!)

Little princess,
wearing a tiara,
knowing that you are a 
princess of the realm;

Little princess,
in your gown of purple,
you're an awesome girl.
You'll smile, (Smile!)
and wave, (Wave!)
and curtsy, (Curtsy!)
and dance and sing. (Sing!)

I think it's really important to learn color. Now you can think whats the best way to learn. I'll say this video will help you how easy to learn colors for children. also I'm sharing others tips below

You can really utilize coloring to educate a preschooler vital lessons. A standout among-st the most essential lessons you will show them are the names of the hues themselves. At the point when a youngster is coloring help them to take in their hues by distinguishing the name of the color in a specific pencil or marker. Before a gathering or individual, have a test where you request that they check particular hues on a clear sheet of paper. You can transform this movement into a little challenge by granting the primary tyke who hues effectively a prize. As youngsters begin have them compose the names of the hues underneath patches of color. 

Request that the kids color creatures and plants properly. Numerous children simply jump at the chance to color with any color in the set. In any case, you can show them essential things about creatures and plants by making them utilize the right hues. As kids get to be amped up for coloring, certain creatures they start to take in more about them. Have rivalries where a kid is to color a specific creature from a photo. You will soon find that the preschoolers are much faster to distinguish distinctive sorts of creatures along these lines. 

Take a stab at utilizing coloring to educate the youngsters numbers or the letter set. Despite the fact that preschoolers won't not know much about numbers or letters they most likely can perceive some fundamental hues. On the off chance that you can relate a specific color with a letter or number the kids will most likely start doing as such themselves. They will have the capacity to recall the fitting names in view of identifying with something they know.

List of Kids Songs;
Teacher Song
Finger Family at Daycare
I want to be Big
10 Little Fish
Baby Goes on a Family Vacation
Baby Gives the toys a bath

There‚Äôs a little toy car
It is mine 
You want it too
What should we do? 

Teacher says when we play 
We must share
Let‚Äôs be nice and let‚Äôs be fair  

I was busy playing
Running around 
I went to fast 
And I fell down 

Teacher always helps me
She‚Äôs my friend
She makes my boo boo better again

Can we see the animals? 
They look cool
I like the animals 
We meet at school 

Teacher makes it fun 
To learn new things
We play games and dance and sing   

We must all be careful 
When we play
The best kind of fun 
Is when we are safe  

Teacher will protect us 
And teach us rules
So when we play we‚Äôre safe at school 

When we come to daycare 
We love to play 
There‚Äôs something new 
To learn everyday 

We get fun surprises 
There‚Äôs lots to do 
Thanks, Ms. Hannah 
We love you

About Nicholeen Peck
========================
Despite your best efforts at raising children, is your family dysfunctional? Do your children set the rules and have control of your home instead of you? Are you looking for parenting skills that will help you create a united, happy family?

Then meet Nicholeen Peck, one of the world‚Äôs most effective parenting experts. Whether you want to fix child behavioral issues, create more unity in the home, or simply strengthen your family relationships, her proven system ‚Äî Teaching Self-Government ‚Äî can help you turn chaos into calm.

In 2009, Nicholeen and her husband starred in the BBC reality TV show, ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Strictest Parents‚Äù (watch here: http://bit.do/StrictestParents). She became an overnight sensation by turning around two out-of-control teenagers from England after just one week ‚Äî without shouting, threats or manipulation.

Lyrics:

We were some presidents of America 
And I know it‚Äôs kind of funny
that they printed us on money
but we‚Äôre officially
the U.S. currency

Well I‚Äôm Abraham Lincoln
16th US president 
And my face is on this Penny here you see

This Penny I‚Äôm on
is only worth one cent 
and it‚Äôs the smallest amount of US cash they‚Äôll be

I‚Äôm Thomas Jefferson
US president number 3
A Nickel is where you‚Äôll find my face today

If you take 5 pennies 
and add them to one coin
You‚Äôll have a Nickel worth 5 cents that you can save

I‚Äôm Franklin D. Roosevelt 
32nd president 
You‚Äôll find my face on a Dime don‚Äôt you know

If you take two nickels 
and put them in one coin
You‚Äôll have 10 cents that's what a Dime is worth 
alone

I‚Äôm George Washington
US President number 1
The Quarter is one place you‚Äôll find me for good

Put 25 pennies
into one coin you‚Äôll have 
a Quarter worth 25 cents hope you understood

We were some presidents of America 
And I know it‚Äôs kind of funny
that they printed us on money
but we‚Äôre officially
the U.S. currency

I‚Äôm George Washington 
and I‚Äôm back once again
On the US dollar, you can‚Äôt get enough of me

If you take four Quarters
and add them to a bill
One dollar‚Äôs worth 4 quarters now you can see

I‚Äôm Thomas Jefferson 
Back to teach you more my friend
I‚Äôm on the two dollar bill you see here now you know

If you take two dollars 
and put them together in one bill
You‚Äôll have a  2 dollar bill now I gotta go

It‚Äôs me again My name is  
Abraham Lincoln 
The 5 dollar bill is also where I‚Äôm shown

When you gather 5 dollar bills 
and put them into one
A 5 dollar bill is what you‚Äôll find on its own

I‚Äôm Alexander Hamilton
I wasn‚Äôt a president
But they put me on the 10 dollar bill anyway

When you have 2 five dollar bills 
and put them into one
It makes a 10 dollar bill for you to spend and play

We were some presidents of America 
And I know it‚Äôs kind of funny
that they printed us on money
but we‚Äôre officially
the U.S. currency

Andrew Jackson here
7th US president
The 20 dollar bill is where you‚Äôll find me

When you take two 10 dollar bills
and put them in one
You get the 20 dollar bill that you can see

I‚Äôm Ulysses S. Grant
the 18th president
And the bill amount you see me on‚Äôs 50

When you take two 20 dollar bills 
and also add two 5‚Äôs
A 50 dollar bill is that there will be

I‚Äôm Benjamin Franklin 
But was not a president
My face is on the one hundred dollar bill

When you take two 50 dollar bills 
and put them into one
A 100 hundred dollar bill is what they‚Äôll fill

We were some presidents of America 
And I know it‚Äôs kind of funny
that they printed us on money
but we‚Äôre officially
the U.S. currency",Kids learning,false

Lyrics:
Everyone has them   
Du lu du lu du      
I want them, too     
Du lu du lu du  
                                                                                                                                                                                            I would like to have them     
Please * 3       
Like my other friends     
Please * 3   
Buy me those shoes       
I can‚Äôt go, can‚Äôt go, can‚Äôt go    
I really want them     
Huh * 3 !         
                                                                                                                                                                                         Everyone has them       
Du lu du lu du   
But do I need them?    
Du lu du lu du   
                                                                                                                                                                                            Do I really need them?      
Think again, think again   
What you need and what you want   
Not the same, not the same       
I should pick what I need     
What I need * 2       
That is number one      
Number one

That hurts, that hurts      
I should have picked what I need    
What I need * 2

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

All children love animals. Preschoolers and children at kindergarten are very eager to learn different animals and imitate the sounds and noises that animals make. Parents and teachers can use our educational videos to teach children the names and sounds of different animals. Kiddopedia channel is known for great animal sounds videos.

This is an excellent method for kids, toddlers, and kindergarten children to learn animal sounds. 

In addition to the animal sounds, translations to 14 more languages of the animals names are shown with each animal.

With a buck buck here and a buck buck there,
here a buck, there a buck,

The insects are the largest group of animals. They live all over the world. In fact, more than 75 percent of all animals are insects. Learning the names of insects is an important part of developing English vocabulary for preschool, kindergarten, as well as for all English learners.

You will hear that some people call all insects ""bugs"". However, this is not correct. Bugs are insects, but not all insects are bugs. 
Most children are interested in animals and insects. Children learn names of insects and bugs birds at the kindergarten age by listening to insect sounds and seeing them with their own eyes. Insects are small creatures. Sometimes, it is really difficult to see and observe the details of an insect‚Äôs body in real life. This video fulfills this educational purpose perfectly by using close-up video footage of insects.

In our insects for kids video, you are going to learn about different insect species and listen to their sounds if they make one. In this video, real videos of insects and bugs with real sounds are presented to teach the names and sounds of insects. Beautiful insect videos in HD together with high-quality sounds is an excellent resource for all bird lovers for entertainment as well as for education.

List of insects in this video: butterfly, bee, ladybug, grasshopper, ant, caterpillar, fly, millipede, cricket, wasp, dragonfly, cockroach, worm, cicada, firefly, praying mantis, snail, damselfly, bumblebee, moth, mosquito, slug

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Try Kids Academy Talented & Gifted app with 3-day FREE TRIAL https://bit.ly/2GJLsU8 Learn How to Read for Kids
Learning a language is a very easy task for kids. Their brain is hardwired to learn a language, therefore, they do not need to be taught how to speak. But reading does not come naturally. Kida has to learn how to read. Several necessary measures are taken and methodologies are applied. According to the new strategies developed about how to read for kids in 2018, this is what needs to be done.

1. Give the Child Phonemic Awareness
To teach kids how to read, it is important to first introduce them to Phonetics. They need to know that speech is made up of individual sounds. Learning strategies and educational videos with sounds should be used to give the kids phonemic awareness. However, there is a difference between speaking and writing.  In order to learn how to read it is important for the kids to recognize the marks that represent the sounds of the language that they learned. These marks are actually the alphabet.

2. Give the Child Alphabetic Awareness
Simply memorizing the alphabet is not enough for reading. In order to develop reading, readiness kids need to learn the letters. It is a complex procedure to tell the kids it identify which sounds go with which alphabet. We have 44 sounds and 26 alphabets. To make this simpler try to use educational videos and games of phonics to help the kids to match the sounds with the letters. Get them phonics letter sets and sound writing boards to make this learning fun.

3. Give the Child Sound to Word Awareness (Blending)
Once they can identify the sounds and matching letters. It is time to teach the kids the blending of sounds to recognize the printed words. For example ‚ÄúCat‚Äù is represented by three letters c ‚Äìa-t and has three sounds. Teach the kids how these sounds blend together to make the word Cat. 

Kids are inherently curious, so once they have the awareness of words the process gets easier. Now is the time to give them interesting books of short stories and read for kids. They will start to follow after you and will eventually develop fluency.

Lyrics:

I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
look in the night sky
To see a part of me
I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
Your solar systems 
just a tiny part of me

The Milky Way name came
from a Greek goddess named Hera
Who spilled milk across the sky  
Greeks believed in that era 

When you look at the darkest sky 
on a clear summers night
And you see the image 
of the Milky way clear in site

Remember you can only see
a small part of me
called the Galactic Core
In my galaxy

Astronomers can‚Äôt look at me
from outside the galaxy
Because I‚Äôm so massive 
and you don‚Äôt have the technology 

Based on other galaxy‚Äôs   
we see outside of our own
Is why we conclude that our
galaxy‚Äôs spiraled as I‚Äôm shown

When you look at a side view
of the Milky way here
You see me as a flat disk 
with a Bulge center I appear 

I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
look in the night sky
To see a part of me
I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
Your solar systems 
just a tiny part of me

I was born about 
13.6 Billion years ago
That's a hypothesis 
given from astronomers though

I am 100,000 light years
in diameter 
That's an estimate given by NASA
though they can‚Äôt be sure 

Your Solar system‚Äôs
This tiny dot that you see right here
Astronomers think the Orion Spur‚Äôs 
where your system appears

Your systems guest to be
25,000 light years 
From the galactic center 
of the milky way shown here

About 230 million years 
is what your system takes
To orbit once around the milky way‚Äôs 
center‚Äôs cool shape

200 to 400 billion stars 
live in me
that's an estimate only 
based on our astronomy 

Over 100 Billion Planets 
might exist in me
Maybe someday you can 
see them in the galaxy

I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
look in the night sky
To see a part of me
I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
Your solar systems 
just a tiny part of me

Let's take a look at all the parts
that you think I‚Äôm made of
We‚Äôll start by looking down 
at the galaxy from above

The Galactic Cores
the rotational center you can‚Äôt see
because of interstellar dust
It cannot be studied

it‚Äôs believed the center
is a supermassive black hole
When Astronomers find out more
then I will let you know

You‚Äôll notice a Galactic bar
and also the Long Bar
Then the 3kpc Arms
There is a Near and there‚Äôs a Far

Then we have the Sagittarius 
and the Norma Arms 
Then the Orion Spur
Where your solar system spins on

The Scutum-Centaurus 
and Perseus Arm
Are two major spirals 
and full of the galaxy‚Äôs charm

Finally the Outer Arm 
and The New Outer Arm
Are the final Spirals 
I will mention in this song

I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
look in the night sky
To see a part of me
I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
Your solar systems 
just a tiny part of me

I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
look in the night sky
To see a part of me
I am the Milky Way 
Galaxy
Your solar systems 
just a tiny part of me",Kids learning,true

Friends Song Lyrics: 

when it‚Äôs hard and you want to hide 
who‚Äôs gonna stay right by your side?
hope never dies and never ends 
as long as you have friends 


Not all the days are happy and sunny and blue
Sometimes the world is falling on you 
When everything looks hard remember in the end 
You'll always have your friend 

In all the struggles, problems, and rocky times 
With all the troubles, tackles and difficult climbs 
Just be grateful to have someone 
To be here for you all the time",Kids learning,false

From All-Time Childrens' Favorites

Lyrics:
You put your right foot in, you take your right foot out, you put your right foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your right arm in, you take your right arm out, you put your right arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your left arm in, you take your left arm out, you put your left arm in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your head in, you take your head out, you put your head in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your knees in, you take your knees out, you put your knees in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your shoulders in, you take your shoulders out, you put your shoulders in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your elbows in, you take your elbows out, you put your elbows in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your bottom in, you take your bottom out, you put your bottom in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your quiet voice in, you take your quiet voice out, you put your quiet in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.
You put your loud voice in, you take your loud voice out, you put your loud voice in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your tummy in, you take your tummy out, you put your tummy in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your nose in, you take your nose out, you put your nose in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

You put your whole self in, you take your whole self out, you put your whole self in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.  That's what it's all about.

V. Prasad Starring : Jeetendra, Tanuja, Sanjeev Kumar, Anjali, Manmohan Krishan, Durga Khote, Bela Bose, Roopesh Kumar, Jagdeep. Music Director : Laxmikant Pyarelal, Lyricist : Anand Bakshi, Singers: Lata Mangeshkar, Mohd. Rafi, Asha Bhonsle , Usha Mangeshkar, Bhupendar, Hemlata.
Synopsis : Desperate to earn money to support his extended family, Mohan becomes entangled in a web of deceit when he tells a lie in order to obtain a secretarial job in the city with the wealthy Mr Rai. He says he isn't married. But he is. Mr Rai has a daughter with a heart condition. She's confined to a wheelchair but Mohan has more than a mild therapeutic effect on her and she is soon up and running - running after him. Meanwhile, back in the village, the money he has been sending home is being filched by his greedy sister. Soon, mother, wife and a flock of children come looking for him and Mohan finds himself leading a double life in an increasingly desperate effort to avoid all parties learning the truth. Everyone is competent and does job well. The direction and acting is good and so the editing, leaving very little scope for audience to think while watching the movie. The run time is to enjoy and thats what this movie precisely does.

20,zlaXQ9VwmFA,Elephant Boy,"Sabu,Elephant,United States of America,Boy,InterPathe,InterPath√©,Inter-Path√©,legal movies,free movies","Toomai (Sabu), a young boy growing up in India, longs to become a hunter. In the meantime, he helps his mahout (elephant driver) father with Kala Nag, a large elephant that has been in their family for four generations.
Petersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work. Amused by Toomai and learning that he has no one but his father to look after him, Petersen allows the boy to come too.
Strangely, no elephants have been seen in the region in a while, so Petersen has staked his reputation on a guess that they will be found further north. However, six weeks of hunting prove fruitless. He is ready to give up, but his right hand man, Machua Appa (Allan Jeayes), persuades him to keep hunting for another month. When the other hired natives learn of Toomai's ambition, they mock him, telling him that he will become a hunter only when he sees the elephants dance (a myth).
One night, Toomai's father spots a tiger prowling near the camp and wakes Petersen. When the two go out to shoot the beast, Toomai's father is killed. Kala Nag's grief becomes so intense, he rampages through the camp, only stopping when Toomai calms him down.
Petersen decides to assign cruel Rham Lahl (Bruce Gordon) to Kala Nag, as Toomai is too young for the job. When Rham Lahl beats the elephant, however, Kala Nag injures his tormenter. The mahout insists that Kala Nag be destroyed, as is the law. Petersen manages to get him to change his mind and accept 100 rupees instead by threatening to have him removed from the safety of the camp.
Unaware of this reprieve, Toomai takes Kala Nag and runs away into the jungle. There, they stumble upon the missing wild elephants, and Toomai sees them dancing. He leads Petersen to them. The other natives are awed, and hail him as ""Toomai of the Elephants"". Machua Appa offers to train the boy to become a hunter, a plan Petersen approves.

Venkateswaran. It stars Rajinikanth, Mammootty and Shobana in the lead roles with Arvind Swamy, Srividya, Amrish Puri, Bhanupriya, Nagesh, and Charuhasan playing supporting ones. The theme is based on the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. The score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film, which features the last collaboration of Mani Ratnam and Ilaiyaraaja,[1] was dubbed and released in Telugu and Hindi as Dalapathi

Production company : G. V. Films

Release date : 5 November 1991

Plot: Surya (Rajinikanth), the abandoned child of fourteen-year-old unwed mother Kalyani (Srividya) is brought up by a generous lady living in the slums. He grows up to become a hot tempered youth who fights the injustice that takes place daily. These qualities lead him to cross swords with the local don Devarajan (Deva) (Mammootty). Deva's friend Ramana is fatally beaten up by Surya, and Deva threatens that if his friend was laid to rest then he will kill Surya. Ramana succumbs to his wounds, and Surya is imprisoned. However, when Deva discovers Ramana's offence, he decides to get Surya released from jail.

Surya is surprised to see Deva send his man to get him out from jail, and there he tells Surya, Nyayamnu onnu irrukku (there is such a thing called justice). From that moment, Deva surrenders his ego and offers his hand of friendship to Surya. Surya pledges that he has nothing else but his life to give his new friend. From then on Deva makes Surya his ""Thalapathi"" (commander). Meanwhile Surya falls for a local girl Subbulakshmi (Shobana). They soon fall in love and their relationship continues. Surya and Deva virtually rule the town with their muscle and their sense of justice, but in the eyes of the government they are anti-social elements. Arjun (Arvind Swamy), posted as the new district collector, plans to arrest both so that he can end their brutal activities. But his opportunities are futile.

At this time, Deva and his wife go to Subbulakshmi's house asking for her betrothal to Surya. But her father refuses stating he cannot marry his daughter to a person who doesn't know about his parents. Instead, Subbulakshmi is married to Arjun. Surya eventually marries another girl (Bhanupriya) who was widowed by him earlier (her husband was Ramana). Surya, still troubled by the guilt, prefers to remain as a guard to the widow and her daughter.

A struggle breaks out between the collector and Deva/Surya during which Surya learns that Arjun's mother is his mother, too. Surya promises his mother that he will not harm Arjun but refuses to leave Deva, whose friendship is more valuable to him than any other relationship. Deva is stunned to learn that collector and Surya are brothers and admires Surya for not parting with him in spite of discovering his identity. During the process of surrendering to the collector, assuring him completely stopping their activities, Deva is shot to death by his enemy. Surya, in a fit of rage, brutally kills Kalivardhan (Amrish Puri) who was the cause for Deva's death and surrenders to the police after performing the final rites of his friend. But the police withdraw the case due to lack of evidence and witnesses. The collector goes to another place on a new posting accompanied by his wife. His mother then changes her mind to stay with her elder son, Surya.

27,PFb8Us4Zoi8,The Human Tower,[],"Set in three countries, the film is a global story of fearless skills and heart-bounding suspense. In the slums of Mumbai, India, Sandeep, a coach with high dreams and a debilitating case of malaria leads his team to break the record and build India‚Äôs biggest human tower at the one-day Dahi Handi Festival. While in Vilafranca de Penedes, Spain, a legendary coach, Melilla, takes his dreams to Santiago, Chile, hoping to share the castellers‚Äô tradition that goes back 400 years. Pressed for time, Melilla needs to prepare the Chilean team for the Universal Forum of Cultures where they will attempt the first seven-level tower in Chile. Helped by Luis, a scholar, they develop a model to unify Chilean society from the bottom up through the human towers. But all it takes is one shaky foot to send hundreds of bodies tumbling into the mud or onto the crumbling pavement. A passion beyond race, borders, and ages.",Kids learning,false

In the video you will see three toddlers (Taika, Saima and Aisla) playing in a ball pit in a playroom and having loads of fun.  The color of each ball is identified by Taika;  the very young toddler Saima also has a go at color identification too.  Although it's an educational video for kids, it should be fun for the whole family.

""Roll over, roll over""
So they all rolled over
And one fell out
 
Seven!

There were seven in a bed
And the little one said
""Roll over, roll over""
So they all rolled over
And one fell out
 
Six!

And the little one said

And one fell out
 
Five!

And the little one said

And one fell out
 
Four!

Galapagos: Realm of Giant Sharks follows a group of researchers who have travelled out to Darwin Island to begin following these dinosaurs of the sea wherever they travel across the globe. But placing satellite tracking devices on giant sharks is not always easy. Steel spear tips bounce off, dangerous currents intervene, and the sharks can deliver bone-crushing swipes with their tails.

In an exciting blend of science and natural history filmmaking, Galapagos: Realm of Giant Sharks uses action-packed, high-resolution photography to draw audiences into the world of one of the ocean‚Äôs largest and least understood creatures.",Kids learning,false

This method of teaching is known as the Montessori 
3 period lesson or Montessori 3 step lesson as it was developed by Maria Montessori the founder of the Montessori Method of Teaching. 

Step 1:
IDENTIFICATION - Information placed in short-term memory. Example ‚ÄúThis is a circle, this is a square‚Ä¶‚Äù. Your preschooler is introduced to and learns to recognize the shapes when they are isolated and named one by one. 

Step 2:
RECOGNITION - Information moves in to long-term memory. After being introduced to the shapes circle, square and triangle your preschooler will enjoy showing that they recognise shapes when called upon to show a named shape, for example ‚ÄúShow me a circle, can you point to a square‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Step 3:
RECOLLECTION
Check to see if information moved to long-term memory

Now for the last step in the Montessori 3 period lesson. You will ask your preschooler to tell you the names of the individual shapes. Example: ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

TIPS:
If you child points out the shape you did not name or says a name incorrectly, do not show disappointment or disapproval, but continue with a new request to check if it was a careless mistake or due to incorrect association of shapes and their names. If it is due to incorrect association then transition smoothly to the previous period in the lesson and repeat the process. If you child becomes frustrated, end the lesson leaving an impression of correct associations in Step 1.

Dancing Robots
From the CD, You Can Dance!
By The Learning Station 
‚Ñó¬©Monopoli/The Learning Station 
LYRICS:
DANCING ROBOTS 3:57
Directions: This a dance where you imitate a dancing robot. It is performed with small jerks to give the impression of motors 
starting and stopping. Keep your posture stiff at all times. When you are directed to stop, stay as motionless as possible. During
the malfunction imitate a 'broken robot', slowly bend at your waist and then powering up again . The dance concludes with the
'broken robot'. Using exaggerated jerking motions and a look of confusion on your face as you drop towards the ground give the
impression that the robot has completely ceased to function.

Robot: ""Tummy in, shoulders back""
Refrain:
Robots stand still. We'll stand up straight not moving.
We'll move then stop. It's hard to bend that steel.
We're stiff and straight with every little motion.
We're just machines but we certainly look real.
Raise your right hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Raise your left hand up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now lower that hand down a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my hands. (2X)
Now turn your head to the right a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head to the left a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
Now turn your head back just a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more...stop
I'm a robot, dancing robot, dancing with my head and arms. (2X)
Robot: ""Stop dancing, robot malfunction, waste slowly bending, dropping down to a
grinding halt. Power up, power up, power up. Power up to standing up straight.""

Repeat Refrain
Raise your right leg up a little bit...stop, A little more...stop, A little more ...stop

Thank you for watching our Counting Coins Song.

 ¬ª¬ª-------------¬§-------------¬´¬´¬ª¬ª-------------¬§-------------¬´¬´

Q. Why is knowing how to count coins important?
A. The aim is to teach children how to understand and use money. To do this they need to be able to count the money they have and to compare it to the cost of what they wish to purchase.

Q.What grade levels do this video target?
A. This video targets learning standards in 2nd Grade. 

Q. Where did you guys come from?
A. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  

Q. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?
A. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  

During testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.

Q. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?

We have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  

Coming Soon:
1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.

2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  

Research has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.

üçé Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! üçé

Our Counting Coins video is aligned with the following Common Core and TEKS standards:

They can be up to 600 miles across, and make a spiraling shape.
Hurricanes are formed over water in tropical areas, and use warm water as energy. They can move 10-20 miles across the ocean.
Most hurricanes happen over water and they aren‚Äôt dangerous to us, but when a hurricane gets close to land, they can cause a lot of damage. Their winds can be up to 200 miles per hour, and they can knock over trees, powerlines, and buildings. They can also cause tornadoes, thunder and lightning, big waves, and flooding.
The hole in the center of a hurricane is called the Eye. It‚Äôs a clear part of the storm‚Äîno clouds or rain at all. But the area closest to the Eye, the Eye Wall, has the fastest and most dangerous rain and wind.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Your kids will love learning their colors with this fun educational video featuring colorful dump trucks transporting loads of toys from the toy factory to the toy stores across town.  We'll identify the colors of the toys and also find the mixed up toy with the wrong color.

In this video, we'll learn about the colours pink, white, gray, black, cyan (or teal or turquoise) and brown.  We'll also review all of the colours we learned in part one: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.

I hope this fun visual presentation helps your little ones to learn their colors and how to apply them to everyday objects.

If your children are enjoying our videos or if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear from you in the comments below.

In this video, we'll also learn some animal sounds along the way. I even learned something myself - I had no idea Zebras sounded like that!  Lizzy is back again with another cameo and even I make a brief appearance in front of the camera and also with a bit of a song (apologies in advance for this...hopefully one day I'll be able to afford to hire proper voice talents). ;)

This one took me almost a month to make in my spare time as I'm still a little bit green when it comes to 3D animation but hopefully the next videos will be out with less of a delay.

***Lyrics***

Five little ducks went out one day 
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But only one little duck came back

One little duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
But none of the five little ducks came back

Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of five little ducks came back

Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack quack quack quack""
And all of the five little ducks came back

How many ducks?
1 2 3 4 5 Yay!

Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away

LYRICS:
Colours! Colours!  
What colours do you see?
Colours! Colours!

The colour red, the colour red
It‚Äôs the colour of the apple on my head
And like Santa bringing presents in his sled
The colour red‚Ä¶   Whoa oh oh! Hey!

The colour blue (colour blue)
The colour blue (colour blue)
It‚Äôs the colour of the sky above you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
And the colour of the ocean too
The colour blue‚Ä¶ Whoa oh oh! 

Colours, colours, colours everywhere
Just look around and a colour will be there
Just pick a spot (pick a spot) and name the colour
There‚Äôs colour everywhere

The colour green, the colour green
Is the greenest colour that I‚Äôve ever seen
Yummy peas, broccoli or a bean
The colour green‚Ä¶ Whoa oh oh! Hey!

The colour yellow (colour yellow)
The colour yellow (yellow)
Pretty as a flower or as bright as the sun
It can be mellow (mellow)
Or very fun! (Wheee!)
The colour yellow, whoah oh oh

Colours, colours, colours everywhere
Just look around and a colour will be there
Just pick a spot (pick a spot) and name the colour
There‚Äôs colour everywhere

The colour pink, the colour pink
My dancing shoes and her tutu are pink
Like flamingos on an ice skating rink
All dressed in pink 
Ohhhhh‚Ä¶

Colours, Colours, Colours everywhere (everywhere there‚Äôs colour)
Just look around and a colour will be there
Just pick a spot (pick a spot) and name the colour
There‚Äôs colour everywhere

There‚Äôs colours, colours, colours everywhere
Pick a spot (pick a spot) and name the colour

Toys are the things that surround kids from the very first days of their lives. So children would surely love to watch this video and listen to my toy song that I sang with my little son. The song is simple enough to be used by English teachers and moms to teach the language to kids and especially to those who learn English as foreign language. It sounds as simple as a nursery rhyme. Ans it's just what is needed to teach and entertain all the young children from babies and toddlers to early school kids. 

Toy song lyrics:

Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.

In botany, a fruit is a seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.

In common language usage, ""fruit"" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, ""fruit"" includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains. The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.

Who loves to eat fruits? Hey Kids, shall we learn about the different fruits we eat? MagicBox Presents you a very interesting compilation of fruit songs, teaching you how to spell them and about them too.. So Sit back, sing along and enjoy these compilations. Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe our pages for more such fun-filled videos.

Oh, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow crayon

Drawing yellow flowers          
Drawing red flowers

It‚Äôs a pretty garden the crayon fairies made.

Oh, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown crayon    
Drawing the blue sea     
Drawing a brown boat       
(Uh? Why doesn‚Äôt the boat move?)     
Pink, pink, pink sail, you need a pink sail.  
Let‚Äôs go sailing          
Let‚Äôs go sailing       
It‚Äôs a little boat the crayon fairies made.   
                                                                                                                                                                                         Um ha ha ha !

He colored everything black, Oh what should we do?     

The garden turned black !     
The sea turned black !

Let‚Äôs draw, let‚Äôs draw, let‚Äôs draw again.    
Let‚Äôs draw like this

LYRICS:

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we‚Äôre the smallest ones  

My name is Ceres
And I‚Äôm a dwarf planet
and the closest dwarf to the sun
The mysterious white spots on my rocky surface
And I am the smallest one

My name is Pluto
I am a Dwarf planet 
And was the ninth planet from the sun
I am one-third water in the form of ice
And I have five moons that are lots of fun

My names Haumea
I am oval in shape
do to the fast rotations that I make
I take 285 years to orbit the sun 
Because I am so far away

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we‚Äôre the smallest ones  

I'm Mah-kee mah-kee
I have no Atmosphere
I was discovered in 2005
I am one of the reasons Pluto lost his status 
So naturally, we do not jive

My name is Eris
I‚Äôm more massive than Pluto 
I am big but I‚Äôm lots of fun
557 is the number of years 
It takes me to revolve around the sun

There are five dwarf planets in our solar system
And we revolve around the sun
Four of us live in the Kuiper Belt 
As far as planets we‚Äôre the smallest ones

HEY EVERYBODY!! Welcome back to the Cave Club!! We have some new members for you to meet! their names are Rockelle and Tryasaurs! Rockelle is the girl doll and Tyra is her dinosaur best friend!! Rockelle and her friend Emberly noticed that there has been sightings of Dino Baby Crystals all over Pirate Island so they wanted to go on an adventure to rescue all of them! I played as Rockelle and my mom played as Emberly. We searched all over the place like up in trees, in the river, and in caves! When we got close to the cave we met up with Tyra who was being played as my dad!! It was so fun grouping up and searching all over the land for new dino babies! We found 3 friends scattered around the island and then we took them home to our treehouse to take care of them! It was so fun playing with these new toys!!

This Alphabet song in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the vowel a.  

Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they‚Äôll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say both the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of a variety of storytelling words.
This letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.
All of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.
Your children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the long and short vowel sounds at the beginning and middle of each word.

Listening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  
The very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.
And, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.

 Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet 
 26 letters, that‚Äôs it, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet
    
Let‚Äôs learn about the letter A
 A is a letter, a is a letter, a is a letter

A is a letter

A is a letter in the alphabet
This is an uppercase A
 Write it in the air like this

This is a lowercase a

This is a lowercase a
Write it in the air like this

Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet

Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
Letter a is a vowel and it has two sounds
I say the short sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the short sound /a/  /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/

At the beginning of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was an alligator, alligator, alligator
On an adventure, adventure, adventure
To pick some apples, apples, apples
To make some applesauce, applesauce, applesauce

In the middle of these words
Listen for the short sound /a/
There was a rat, rat, rat
And his friend the cat, cat, cat
They loved to rap, rap, rap
In their cool caps, caps, caps

I say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
Now you say the long sound /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/ /a/
At the beginning of these words, listen for the long sound /a/
In April, April, April
I met an ape, ape, ape
Who wore an apron, apron, apron
To eat some acorns, acorns, acorns

In the middle of these words
Listen for the long sound /a/
There was a snake, snake, snake
Down by the lake, lake, lake
Who baked a cake, cake, cake
In a silly shape, shape, shape


It‚Äôs fun to learn about the alphabet
And I‚Äôm really gonna‚Äô try and do my best
Learn each letter, learn each sound
Learn how to write each letter down
I feel so good deep inside
Right now I‚Äôm learning how to read and write

Get ready, get set, Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet

The Moon and the Earth

Hello friends, welcome to a new video from Happy Learning. Today we are going to learn about‚Ä¶ the Moon.

The Moon is the only satellite that rotates around our planet and it takes 28 days to completely go around the Earth. But, do we now what a satellite is? A natural satellite is any kind of celestial body that rotates, or actually, orbits around a planet.

The Moon is never still, it moves and in two ways. It has a movement of rotation, which means it turns in its own axis, and a movement of translation, that is to say, it rotates around the Earth. 
The duration of the movement of rotation and translation is 28 days. Because it takes the same amount to rotate on its own axis and to completely go around the Earth, the Moon always shows us the same face.

When we observe the Moon along a period of time it appears to change shape. These changes in appearance are called lunar phases and they repeat every 28 days. There are four: full Moon, first quarter, new Moon and last quarter. The Moon phases are produced by two reasons: the movement of the Moon around the Earth and because the Moon reflects light form the sun as a mirror.

New Moon
In this phase the Moon is passing between the Earth and the Sun. The illuminated face of the Moon is facing the opposite direction to Earth. The dark side ends up facing the Earth, and this is why we cannot see the Moon.

First Quarter
You can see it approximately one week after the new Moon.  One half of the illuminated side faces the Earth. It is called the first quarter because, from the new Moon phase, the zone illuminated by the sun grows every time.

Full Moon
Approximately a week after the first quarter, we can see the whole Moon illuminated. The Earth is between the Moon and the sun and we can see it fully.

Last Quarter
The Moon presents its other half face illuminated. The name of the last quarter comes from the fact that the illuminated side becomes smaller and smaller each time

A very easy trick to now whether the Moon is in its first or last quarter is the following. If the Moon has the shape of a C, it is in its last quarter and if it has the shape of a D, it is in its first quarter.

So now you know, the Moon has 4 phases:
New Moon, first quarter, full Moon and last quarter.

Know we are going to learn a few facts about the Moon

Do you know the distance between the Moon and the Earth? Although it looks as though it is not very far away, the Moon is about 385,000 kilometers from the Earth.

Another very interesting fact is that a rocket takes three days to get to the Moon. Its incredible, isn‚Äôt it?

The first astronaut that stepped on the Moon was Neil Armstrong and this very important accomplishment occurred in the year 1969 aboard the Apollo 11 rocket.

The Moon is 4 times smaller than the Earth, but it is very important for the sustainability of life in our planet. The Moon generates tides; Do you now what that is? A tide is the rise and fall of the sea level. They occur every 6 hours approximately.

Well now you know a little bit more about the Moon, very interesting, right?

Mom and dad both play guitar a little bit, so the kids got little kid-sized guitars for them to start playing and learning how to play. In order to hold their attention so they don't get frustrated with having to strum while also learning where their fingers go to play chords, ChordBuddy was cool enough to send us two guitars that use their ChordBuddy system for making easy for anyone to pick up a guitar and instantly start playing their favorite songs. It worked for our kids!

An octopus that was squiggling in the water!

Imagine you have a big soup pot in front of you. When the song directs you to add a new ingredient, pretend to be placing it into the pot, then stir your soup and scoop a taste. Follow along with the call backs. For the final verse, pretend you are filling bowls and then everyone gobbles up their soup. Variation: To enhance the message of team work have the children take turns adding each ingredient.

Clean Up is Fun
From the CD, Play to Rest

Lyrics:
Chorus
Clean up is fun, when we clean and sing this song.
So come on and clean together and sing along.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, come on and clean together and sing along.

Verse
Put the blocks up on the shelf, put the trucks away.
Everything has a place to stay.
Tomorrow will be another day that we can play.
Put the games up on the shelf, put the dolls away.
Everything has a place to stay.
Tomorrow will be another day that we can play.

Chorus
Clean up is fun, when we clean and sing this song.
So come on and clean together and sing along.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, come on and clean together and sing along.

Verse
Put the books up on the shelf, put the crayons away.
Everything has a place to stay.
Tomorrow will be another day that we can play.
Put the puzzles on the shelf, put the toys away.
Everything has a place to stay.
Tomorrow will be another day that we can play.

Maple Leaf Learning Playhouse is an educational channel for kids to learn with simple crafts, coloring sheets, songs, toys and games for children! Great for toddlers, preschoolers and kindergarten children.

All of our songs, games and activities are developed and tested in-house by experienced teachers at our well-established language school in Japan. Kids learn best when they don‚Äôt realize that they‚Äôre learning. Our materials are often inspired by natural play and interaction in the classroom. 

Our unique style of blending physical elements (realia) into songs will get even the most shy, unwilling children hooked, participating and singing along. With a big scoop of fun and a sprinkle of silly, we make learning incredibly fun. So, you‚Äôre sure to have instant hits that children will ask for again and again.",Kids learning,true

I am Arugula- My name starts with an A- I‚Äôm a great source of vitamin A, C, and K.

I am Broccoli- My name starts with a B- A cruciferous veggie And an anti-cancer green

I am Cabbage - My name starts with a C - I am leafy green or purple. And a brain food you eat

I am Daikon - My name starts with a D - I grow underground because I‚Äôm a root veggie

I am Endive - My name starts with an E - I am very hard to grow so you may never get to eat me

I am Fennel - My name starts with an F - Your parents can me cook even if they aren‚Äôt a chef

I am Ice Plant- My name starts with an I - If you have a belly ache I‚Äôll make your stomach fine

I am a Jute - My name starts with a J - I‚Äôm loaded with fiber. I make a rope that doesn‚Äôt fray

I am Lettuce - My name starts with an L - I‚Äôm loaded with Potassium- Your tables where I dwell   

I am Maca - My name starts with an M - I‚Äôm a root vegetable with a long brown stem

I'm a Neem Plant - My name starts with an N - I‚Äôm a natural pesticide -  so you can safely spray your garden

I‚Äôm an Onion - My name starts with an O - I come different colors- Underground is where I grow

I am Parsley - My name starts with a P - I am a herb, spice, and veggie that you‚Äôll love to eat

I am Spinach - My name starts with an S - I am very high in iron you should eat me I‚Äôm the best  

I‚Äôm a Turnip - My name starts with a T - I am a root vegetable high in vitamin C 

I‚Äôm Ulluco - My name starts with a U - I look like a potato full of calcium too


We are the Vegetables we hope you like our song

I'm a Zucchini-  My first letter is a Z - I am actually a fruit but most think that I‚Äôm a veggie

We are the Vegetables we hope you like our song

Lyrics:
I am the Multiplication Table
Remember me because you are able
We‚Äôll learn to multiply 1 through 10
Up to 100 because you can

Let‚Äôs start by learning how the Times Table works  
Because learning to multiply is one of life's perks 

You see that vertical line
It‚Äôs numbered 1 through 10
And that horizontal line is numbered the same again

All these numbers on the inside we will cover next
They‚Äôre the answers to the equations  
You will see in a text

For example, if you look at 
the number 2 
And want to multiply it by 7 
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll do

Let‚Äôs use this 2 from the 
vertical side 
And multiply it with the 7 on the horizontal guide 

Run a line from the 2 if you know 
what I mean
And a line from the 7 down to see where they meet

Where the two lines collide will be the  answer you seek
2 X 7 = 14 
This equation is complete  

You can also use the Horizontal number 
2 
And the Vertical 7 to achieve the same results it‚Äôs true 

Now let‚Äôs try and multiply 
5 X 5
Where the two lines meet the answer is 25 

Another example is multiplying  
9 X 6
The two lines meet at 54 where your eyes are transfixed 

Here‚Äôs one more equation it‚Äôs 
8 X 4
The answer is 32. After this chorus, there‚Äôs more

I am the Multiplication Table
Remember me because you are able
We‚Äôll learn to multiply 1 through 10
Up to 100 because you can

When we start at the X
And count diagonally down
You‚Äôll find the answer to each number multiplied by itself without a frown

You‚Äôll see 1 X 1 = 1 and here are some more 
Then you see 2 X 2 and it does equal 4

3 X 3 = 9 and 4 X 4 is 16
5 X 5 is 25 now you know what I mean

6 X 6 = 36 and 7 X 7 is 49 
8 X 8 = 64 I know you‚Äôre feeling fine
9 X 9 = 81. Yeah, that‚Äôs what I said. 
And 10 X 10 = 100 you can see here in red
You can move across or down and 
And multiply each number on its own
Let‚Äôs try a couple out
Then you can continue at home 
Multiplying by 1. Yeah, 
it is so easy 
You always end up with the same number 
you multiplied by you see
For example, 1 X 1 = 1 and 2 X 1 is 2
And 3 X 1 = 3. Now you practice too
Let‚Äôs move to 2 and count straight across
2 4 6 8 10 Start over if you‚Äôre lost
12 14 16 18 and 20
Let‚Äôs try one more row. Start at number 3 
3 6 9 12 15 18
21 24 27 and 30 
Download your time's table sheet from KLT‚Äôs site
And practice multiplying till you get it right

Lyrics:
Science, Oh, Oh, Oh
Science is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
 Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that‚Äôs called migration, hibernation, migration.
Frogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that‚Äôs called hibernation.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Evaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn‚Äôt last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can‚Äôt see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Gravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Metamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don‚Äôt know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!
Say, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),
and metamorphosis (metamorphosis).
Science is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.
Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.

41,dktnOPfE7Dc,"Dinosaurs for Kids | Learn about Dinosaur History, Fossils, Dinosaur Extinction and more!","Dinosaurs for Kids,Dinosaurs History,Dinosaurs history for kids,dinosaurs,Clarendon Learning","Dinosaurs for Kids is a fun and comprehensive look at dinosaur history. In this video we highlight the various kinds of dinosaurs, talk about how they receive their names, famous dinosaur fossils, and we talk about the people who find dinosaur fossils: Paleontologists. 

We think that one of the most fascinating creatures to ever roam the Earth was the dinosaur. You most likely have heard of dinosaurs, seen pictures of them on TV or the Internet, or may have seen their bones in a museum. Dinosaurs are an interesting group of animals that no longer exist, meaning they are extinct. Dinosaurs evolved, meaning they changed, over millions of years. 

In this dinosaur for kids video we also talk about how the dinosaurs‚Äô extinction took place about 66 million years ago and 75% of all life on Earth died. There are many theories or guesses as to what may have happened leading to the extinction. They include worldwide volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth‚Äôs climate, or perhaps a meteorite from space smashing into the Earth. 

If you're looking for more Dinosaur resources check out our FREE comprehensive lesson plan complete with fun activities, worksheets, quizzes and more! The free dinosaur lesson can be found at:

Kids learn phonics and letter recognition while singing and having fun. In this version I use realistic pictures for real life examples of each beginning sound object. I have movements for each letter for building  brain and body connections.

In my phonics song images appear on screen to show examples of words that beginning with each letter of the alphabet.

Lyrics:

I am a star
Called the sun 
I'm the center of our solar system
You revolve 
around me
As we fly around the galaxy 

All of the planets 
in our solar system
they Orbit while they 
follow me

230 million years
is the time I take 
to fly around
the milky way galaxy 
 
I don‚Äôt have a solid surface
I‚Äôm made up of gasses
Held together by my own gravity

I‚Äôm made of 92.1 percent 
hydrogen (H2) 
and 7.8 percent helium (He)

I am a star
Called the sun 
I'm the center of our solar system
You revolve 
around me
As we fly around the galaxy 

My core is 25% of my total mass
And  27 million degrees

my energy is the reason
there is life on Earth
They‚Äôll be no charge cuz I‚Äôm totally free
 
my mass makes up 99.8%
of our solar system
nothing in our systems hot as me

I am a star
Called the sun 
I'm the center of our solar system
You revolve 
around me
As we fly around the galaxy

Apes are primates. The main difference of apes to other primates such as monkeys is that they do not have a tail. The types of apes are the great apes and the lesser apes. Here are the five of great apes: gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, humans, and bonobos. Gibbons and siamangs belong to the family of lesser apes.

In this video, real videos of apes are shown to small children to teach the apes vocabulary. Several different great apes and lesser apes are presented with the native British English pronunciation of their name. Ape sounds in combination with HD ape videos are a perfect educational method for kids to learn animal names.

Follow the directions in the song.
Stop and Go songs stimulate the frontal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes allow us to set and achieve goals, and have impulse control and empathy for others. Move and Freeze is an action song for children that helps you achieve!
Lyrics:
Chorus:
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put your right hand on your left knee, 
your left hand on your right.
Your knees move in and out. 
Your hands stay tight.
Now keep on with your moving 
but switch hands on your knees.
Keep on moving in and out till we say freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
C‚Äômon, move and freeze. C‚Äômon, move and freeze.
Put one hand across your shoulder 
one hand across your back.
Now jump in place. Do you like it like that?
Now switch hands across your shoulders 
and switch hands across your back.
Now just be nimble, just be quick, just like Jack.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
C‚Äômon, jump and freeze. C‚Äômon, jump and freeze.
Everybody shake your body from your head down to your feet.
And don‚Äôt stop shaking until we stop the beat.
Shake it to the east and shake it to the west.
Shake it, shake it, shake it with my friends who are the best.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
C‚Äômon, shake and freeze. C‚Äômon, shake and freeze.
Put your right hand on your head, your left on someone‚Äôs knee.
Now turn once in a circle and buzz like a bee.
Now turn the other way, don‚Äôt let go or lose your spot.
Keep turning left, keep turning right until the music stops.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
C‚Äômon, turn and freeze. C‚Äômon, turn and freeze.
‚ÄúAlright, you can move now.‚Äù

An Advenutre to the planets

Lets‚Äô learn about all the planets.
The solar system is really an exciting place.
The sun is the center of solar system.

The first person to set foot on the Moon was Neil Armstrong.


The smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury and the largest planet is Jupiter.

Earth is where we live.

This red planet is called mars.

Venus is the brightest planet.

Saturn has beautiful rings that go round and round.

Uranus and Neptune are dark, cold, and very windy.

Lyrics:
Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only four ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Four little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only three ghosts flew.

1, 2, 3.

Three little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only two ghosts flew.

1, 2. 

Two little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house only one ghost flew.

1. 

One little ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
But back to the house no little ghosts flew. 

Sad mother ghost went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew. 

Five little ghosts went out one night.
Haunting, spooking, what a fright.
Mother ghost said boooooooo...boo!
And back to the house all the five ghosts flew.

All of the magic tricks are simple and quick for kids to learn and perform. And they're great for grown-ups who would like to teach kids some easy magic tricks.  

All of the tricks employ household items and some are basic craft projects that can be activiites in themselves. So whether you're a teacher, parent, or scout leader, you can quickly follow our lessons on great tricks for kids to learn and perform. You'll also find ideas for magic that kids can perform for a school, pack meeting, assembly, Blue & Gold Dinner or other event.

Please forward questions that you may have in the comments. I try my best to answer all questions. 

I've included the vanishing toothpick trick here because it's a great one for kids to learn and perform. In my experience, kids love the trick. However, I do understand that a toothpick can be problematic with its sharp points. So please be cautious. One idea is to break the sharp point from the toothpick. If any grown-ups out there come up with a better object for the trick, please comment below so others may benefit.

We love to be at the zoo
Always learning something new
We love to be at the zoo
You can come along too!

Come see all the animals
This is where they live
In the ground and in the trees
So much fun to be with!

I love to be at the zoo
Crocodiles can swim ‚Äúit‚Äôs true!‚Äù
I love to be at the zoo
Let‚Äôs learn something new

They have tails they‚Äôre really long
They use them to swim
See their scales and spiky teeth
In the water they live

I love to be at the zoo
See the lions there ‚Äúwoohoo!‚Äù
I love to be at the zoo
Let‚Äôs learn something new

Lions run and jump real fast
You can hear them roar 
Lions have such awesome manes
The cubs have tiny claws

I love to be at the zoo
See the giraffes ‚Äútheir neck‚Äôs so long!‚Äù
Giraffes have spotty patterns too
Let‚Äôs learn something new

Giraffes are the tallest animals
They reach the highest trees
That is lucky for giraffes
Because they only eat leaves

‚òÖ 6 Times Table - Multiplication Song Lyrics ‚òÖ

6 x 0 = 0
My dog‚Äôs name is Bingo
6 x 1 = 6
He does many tricks
6 x 2 = 12
Bingo is my best friend
6 x 3 = 18
And will always be

6 x 4 = 24
Someone knocked on my door
6 x 5 = 30
And he was there all dirty
6 x 6 = 36
A good bath was a great fix
6 x 7 = 42
And Bingo was brand new

6 x 8 = 48
Bingo and I went out to skate
6 x 9 = 54
I love him more and more
6 x 10 = 60
Bingo likes to play with me
Multiply by six
I hope you like the pics

15,Zynqkcfn8UE,Talking To Kids About Identity And Race | Dinosaur Storytime | Circle Time with Khan Academy Kids,"diversity,race,t-rex,dinosaur,dinosaurs,racism,kids,storytime,social justice for kids","Join us for the second video in our diversity series on Circle Time with Khan Academy Kids. Today, we welcome back Teacher Naomi and her son Noah who help explain the concepts of identity and race. Learn how scientists and society sometimes study and group people based on similarities. Then, listen to the difference between grouping in a good way (to build community) versus grouping in a bad way (racism). Getting to know people, rather than making judgments about skin color, is an important step in building a healthy community. 

Continue the conversation with Caroline and Sophie as they talk about similarities and differences, like where they‚Äôre from, how they speak, and their family customs and traditions. Then read along to the story ‚ÄúGot to Be Me‚Äù by Cynthia Platt. Meet T-Rex the dinosaur who dared to be different. Finally, enjoy a diverse selection of artwork made by friends around the world! 

This video is the second in a series that explains the values of diversity, race, and justice to young children. Our special guest, Naomi O‚ÄôBrien, is a teacher, author, mother, and advocate for social justice. Learn more about Naomi at https://readlikearockstarteaching.com/. 

The series is aligned with the guidelines for anti-bias education from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. NAEYC curriculum goals include helping to develop a child‚Äôs positive personal identity, empathy towards others, and the awareness of fairness. 

We‚Äôd love to hear your child‚Äôs story. Send their pictures or drawings to our team at http://khan.co/KhanKids-SubmitYourArt. When we hear more stories, we have more to share and celebrate!

He was called 'The Phoenix of Indian Cinema'. He made his debut in the 1972 film, Vamsha Vriksha, in a supporting role. The same year he played the lead role in Puttanna Kanagal's Naagarahaavu, and was recognized as the Angry young man of Kannada cinema. He has played a variety of roles in different genres. 
. 
Vishnuvardhan was born in Mysore to H. L. Narayana Rao and Kamakshamma. His ancestors are from Hallegere, Mandya district of Karnataka. His father was an artist, music composer and a scriptwriter who was known for his collection of musical instruments. His sister Rama was a Kathak dancer at the Mysore Palace. He had six siblings. He was educated first in Mysore's Gopalswamy School and then at Bangalore's Kannada Model High School. He attended high school and obtained a degree from National College, Basavanagudi, Bangalore
Vishnuvardhan married actress Bharathi on 17 February 1975 in Bangalore. They have adopted two children, Keerthi and Chandana. Vishnuvardhan started his career with the National Award-winning movie Vamshavruksha (1972) directed by Girish Karnad based on the novel written by S. L. Bhyrappa. His first lead role was in Naagarahaavu, directed by Puttanna Kanagal and based on a novel by T. R. Subba Rao. It was the first in Kannada film history to complete 100 days in three main theatres of Bangalore. In his 35-year career, he has played a variety of roles in more than 200 films. 

S. P. Balasubrahmanyam is record-holder for having sung more than 40,000 songs in Indian languages including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi. SPB's voice suited Vishnuvardhan, and people felt it was a perfect combination. He started singing for Vishnuvardhan in the 1972 film Naagarahaavu. Vishnuvardhan never missed any of the birthdays of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. In every film of the actor, he had to sing couple of songs and Vishnu would insist. Balasubrahmanyam has sung all the five songs in his last Kannada film. Aptharakshaka and was awarded the Best Playback Singer Filmfare Award for the song Gharane Ghara Gharane. He dedicated his award to Vishnuvardhan. After Vishnuvardhan's death, Balasubrahmanyam paid tribute to him in musical nights and one such show happened in Bengaluru and Mysuru.

He started singing in movies occasionally and later went on to singing devotional songs for albums. The first song he sang was in the movie Nagarahole and he has recorded some duet songs with the notable legendary singers S. Janaki and P. Susheela. The first devotional album sung by him was on Lord Ayappa and the title of the album was Jyothiroopa Ayappa. His other albums were ""Thayi Bhanashankari"" (on goddess Banashankari) and Vishwapremi Ayappa. He also sang devotional songs on Dharmastala's Lord Manjunathaswamy, Malemadeshwara and Ranachandi Chamundi

Earth is our beautiful home,  sweet home 
And Mars is the red planet next to us.

These are the 8 planets in the milky way 
So come and sing the planet song with us 

Jupiter‚Äôs the biggest planet of them all 
Saturn is the one with the awesome rings 
Uranus is sideways so you better hang on 
And Neptune has the strongest winds

ABOUT THE DINOSAUR PATROL üòÄüé¢üé°üöÇü¶ñ
 
Welcome to our dinosaurs for kids channel, where Chase and Cole are the Dinosaur Patrol in their very own Jurassic World.  If you're looking for educational, entertaining, safe and family friendly content then subscribe now and join along for all of our Dinosaur Adventures. We want you to be in the Dino Squad and want to teach you about all different dinosaurs around the world so you can learn how you can become part of the Dinosaur Patrol.

The Dinosaur Patrol will go on Dinosaur rescue missions every week to save the Dinosaurs who are stranded across the country after getting free from Jurassic World. When they are not using their Jurassic Park Power Wheels to save their Dinosaur friends, they do what friends do, go to the movies, to the beach, to the carnival, to the parks and all sorts of fun places. But sometimes even a trip to park can turn into an unexpected adventure!
 
We will be posting NEW videos to our Dinosaur Channel every Friday. And who knows, maybe we will add in a Saturday if our Dinosaur Parks start to fill up.

‚òÖ Classification Maths cartoon story
Every morning is study time in Banu, Bablu's home. Before the papa went into the office, he scrutinizes everyone's homework and notes. But once the pap is out it's time to play, at least for Banu and Bablu. The same happened this day too. Banu and Bablu ran into the sister's room. Within a flash of a minute, everything became a mess. The globe is bouncing like a football, the books are flying and the Abacus is now a bunch of colored balls and wood pieces. The mom came and interfered with their play. She was furious and asks them to put everything back in order. Banu and Bablu agreed to organize everything and they had learned one important basic concept of Mathematics named classification.

‚òÖ Arrogance moral story
One morning Kathu the cute kitten woke up in an ugly mood. She started to quarrel from the bed. Mama came and serve the breakfast. It's tasty fish for today.

Kids Shapes and Colors will not bombard your child with purchase requests. There is only ONE in-app purchase. 
The app contains six activities. Three are free. The remaining three are available for purchase with a SINGLE in-app purchase.
Now that this house-keeping info is out of the way, let's talk about the app itself!
Learning can be fun - especially when your teachers are toys! Meet Teddy, Doll and Horse and learn about colors and shapes. Your children will match shapes, do puzzles and color drawings. Teddy will reward them with a star each time they do well. Let's play and learn!
Kids Shapes and Colors features six activities that gradually get more challenging so that the child could learn shapes and colors step by step.
Match Shapes
Match geometric shapes with Teddy‚Äôs drawings to learn colors and names of different shapes.
Catch Shapes
Catch the flying geometric shapes and match them with their drawings.
Coloring
Select the correct crayon and color the picture.
Toy Puzzles
Drag toy parts onto the shape of the toy and put the toys back together.
Match Colors
Sort out pencils and crayons by putting them in correct places ‚Äì drawers or pencil cases of the same color and learn the color and name of the object.
