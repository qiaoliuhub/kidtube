That way they will be ready for the spelling test!  We use fun, fancy clipart to bring together our electronic program.  It's for the beginner, early primary grade spellers, typically a 6 year old or under.  And remember, early spelling is not always about being correct, but listening for the acceptable sounds they hear (e.g. \"bat\" might be \"bt\" \"bet\" or even just \"b\").  The words you select should be a challenge level of medium without frustration, and practice throughout the week as you would any skill you want to improve.  If the child is having trouble hearing sounds in words, switch to a visual style as that might be a stronger way of processing for that particular kid.\n\nOur goal at Mr. B's Brain is to use YouTube as an enrichment for school.  We aim to help each student with animated learning opportunities.  We have gotten feedback that our lessons are effective for the toddler all the way to the adult - as it helps moms and dads learn how to teach their students in better ways.

And then he howled OOOOH. \nAnd he hopped and shouted FREEZE!\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\n\nWe tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? \nA silly, spooky skeleton waving cheerfully. \n He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye\nAnd then we started dancing much to our surprise.\nWe started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.\nAnd then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. \nAnd he hopped and shouted FREEZE!\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\n\nWe tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? \nA wild, wacky werewolf waving cheerfully. \n He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye\nAnd then we started dancing much to our surprise.\nWe started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.\nAnd then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. \nAnd he hopped and shouted FREEZE!\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe through the haunted house we go.\n\nWe tip toed through the haunted house and what did we see? \nA very vain vampire waving cheerfully. \n He wiggled and he wobbled and he winked his eye\nAnd then we started dancing much to our surprise.\nWe started mashing, toe tapping, we touched our toes and knees.\nAnd then he growled RAAAW! And then he howled OOOOH. \nAnd he hopped and shouted FREEZE!\nTip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe out of the house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe out of the haunted house we go.\nTip toe, tip toe, make sure you close the door.\nSOUND EFFECT- Door closing to a slam!\n\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!
