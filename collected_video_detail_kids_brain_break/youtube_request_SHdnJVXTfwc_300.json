(Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nThat's what Tony knows.

(Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)\nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)\nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)\nAnd there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)\nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)\nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n**************************\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!

(Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nTony knows.  Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) \nTony Chestnut knows I love you. (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nThat's what Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.)                                                          \nTony, Tony and his sister Eileen.  (Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)\nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)\nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)\nAnd there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)\nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)\nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n**************************\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!

What is a fraction?\nA. A fraction has a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number).  The numerator is how many parts (cookies, slices, things etc.) we have, while the denominator represents how many times those parts are being divided/shared.\n\nQ. What grade levels does our Fractions Song For Kids target?\nA. 2nd Grade - 3rd Grade.\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\nHope to see you at https://numberock.com!\n\nThis fractions video is aligned with the following Common Core and TEKS standards:\n\nCommon Core Standards\n3.NF.A.1 | 3.NF.1\nUnderstand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.\n3.NF.A.2 | 3.NF.2\nUnderstand a fraction as a number on the number line; represent fractions on a number line diagram.\n\nTEKS Standards\n2.3B \nThe student is expected to explain that the more fractional parts used to make a whole, the smaller the part; and the fewer the fractional parts, the larger the part.\n3.3A\nThe student is expected to represent fractions greater than zero and less than or equal to one with denominators of 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 using concrete objects and pictorial models, including strip diagrams and number lines.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTce7f6KGE0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTce7f6KGE0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTce7f6KGE0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTce7f6KGE0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Math Songs by NUMBEROCK", "tags": ["Fractions", "Fractions For Kids", "Fractions Song", "Fractions Song for Kids", "Fractions Kindergarten", "Fractions 1st Grade", "Fractions 2nd Grade", "Fractions 3rd Grade", "Fractions Grade 1", "Fractions Grade 2", "Fractions Grade 3", "Fractions are Parts", "What are Fractions", "What are Fractions For Kids", "teaching fractions to children", "teaching fractions 2nd grade", "teaching fractions 3rd grade", "fractions for kindergarten", "Fractions For Kids Song"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Fractions Song For Kids | 2nd Grade - 3rd Grade", "description": "\ud83c\udf4e  Enjoy our growing library of math videos beyond our fractions song for kids at https://www.numberock.com  \ud83c\udf4e\n\n\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nQ.

Up until today, we have created nearly 30 animated music videos that cover mathematical concepts for 3rd Grade, 4th Grade, and 5th Grade; concepts like, Rounding Numbers, Ordering Decimals, Subtraction, 3D Shapes, Types of Angles and much more!  \n\nWe're curious to see how our teaching resource will be used now that we have shared them with a broader audience.  Thanks for your interest.\n\nHow did NUMBEROCK begin?\n\nWhen you look at the entertainment that\u2019s being\nproduced for kids in games and movies, it\u2019s no wonder\nthat kids are starting to zone out in school. \n\nDuring the last 7 years as an elementary public school teacher, I\u2019ve\nalways tried to find new ways to capture my students\u2019\nfull attention, especially for that one subject that gets\nsuch a notoriously bad rap in elementary school \u2013 math.\n\nOne day I brought my guitar in to school to play a song\nI\u2019d written about Long Division that was accompanied\nby some simple animations I\u2019d made. While not all my\nstudents liked the folk rock genre, I could tell I had everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nSoon I began writing songs in genres that my students\nactually listened to: rap, rock, pop, country, you name\nit. Parents would tell me that their kids were singing the\nsongs in the car, at dinner, even teaching them to their\nsiblings.

Up until today, we have created nearly 30 animated music videos that cover mathematical concepts for 3rd Grade, 4th Grade, and 5th Grade; concepts like, Rounding Numbers, Ordering Decimals, Subtraction, 3D Shapes, Types of Angles and much more!  \n\nWe're curious to see how our teaching resource will be used now that we have shared them with a broader audience.  Thanks for your interest.\n\nHow did NUMBEROCK begin?\n\nWhen you look at the entertainment that\u2019s being\nproduced for kids in games and movies, it\u2019s no wonder\nthat kids are starting to zone out in school. \n\nDuring the last 7 years as an elementary public school teacher, I\u2019ve\nalways tried to find new ways to capture my students\u2019\nfull attention, especially for that one subject that gets\nsuch a notoriously bad rap in elementary school \u2013 math.\n\nOne day I brought my guitar in to school to play a song\nI\u2019d written about Long Division that was accompanied\nby some simple animations I\u2019d made. While not all my\nstudents liked the folk rock genre, I could tell I had everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nSoon I began writing songs in genres that my students\nactually listened to: rap, rock, pop, country, you name\nit. Parents would tell me that their kids were singing the\nsongs in the car, at dinner, even teaching them to their\nsiblings. Almost in disbelief that kids were singing my\nmath songs for fun outside of school, I felt encouraged\nand inspired to keep writing. Then, three years ago, I\nhad one of those \u2018AHA!\u2019 moments: to write a song with a\nsimple animation for every math concept I had to teach.\n\nAltogether, from 2008 to now, I\u2019ve written songs for\nnearly 50 concepts, 30 of which are now professionally\nanimated.

The routines you have developed to learn English have become routine and you are used to them.

How to Break Through the English Learning Plateau!", "description": "Sometimes when you are learning English you feel like you aren't making progress. You have hit a plateau. A plateau in learning occurs when you keep working at learning, but you can't seem to get better at the language.\n\nThis occurs because your mind adapts to the things you are doing. The routines you have developed to learn English have become routine and you are used to them. You need to change things up a bit.\n\nIn this English lesson I will help you understand what a learning plateau is, and I'll give you 5 important strategies that you can use to break through the English learning plateau!\n\n\u231b Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!\n\n--\n\n\u2705 Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:\n\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udcb2 If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join\n\nBecoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:\n1) For 10 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the \"Members Only\" chat.\n2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.\n3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.\n4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, \"Wednesdays with Bob\".
