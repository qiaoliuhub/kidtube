Subitizing develops math fluency, when students recognize sets without having to count each object and it helps develop number sense and the ability to perform mental math. In this version we subitize up to 5 and then give the answer for reinforcement. Have fun subitizing with this subitize song.\n\nLyrics\nYippee, ki-yo, ki-yay\nI love to subitize every day\nMy name is Cowboy Jack and I can subitize fast\nSee if you can answer faster than me\n\nOK partners, don't count\nUse your brain and eyes\nThink quick\nSubitize\nI'll show you a set, you do your best\n\n3\n2\n4\n1\n5\n4\n0\n3\n5\n2\n4\n4\n\nYippee, ki-yo, ki-yay\nI love to subitize every day\nMy name is Cowboy Jack and I can subitize fast\nSee if you can answer faster than me\n\n5\n3\n4\n2\n0\n1\n4\n4\n3\n5\n5\n0\n\nYippee, ki-yo, ki-yay\nI love to subitize every day\nMy name is Cowboy Jack and I can subitize fast\nSee if you can answer faster than me\n5\n5\n2\n4\n0\n3\n1\n4\n4\n2\n5\n5\nYippee, ki-yo, ki-yay\nI love to subitize every day\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: www.jackhartmann.com\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nYouTube: youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle+: goo.gl/GW7SPs\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: jackhartmann.com\niTunes: goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M57S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "197315", "likeCount": "417", "dislikeCount": "51", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "s8vJI6nyh8qDFqt8lGTA2XeqmI8", "id": "MFzDaBzBlL0", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2015-04-24T23:01:29Z", "channelId": "UC6107grRI4m0o2-emgoDnAA", "title": "The Backwards Brain Bicycle - Smarter Every Day 133", "description": "Get your own here  \u21d2 http://bit.ly/BuyBackwardsBike \u21d0 Shirt: https://goo.gl/doOG3G\nI give talks: http://www.smartereveryday.com/appearances \nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\nTweet \u21d2 http://bit.ly/BackwardsBike \u21d0 \u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193Read More \u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\nA quick clarification....\nIt took me 8 months to learn how to do this, but I was only picking up the bike and running to the end of the driveway and back every day.
