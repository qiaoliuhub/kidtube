When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the mid-line. \n\nCrossover tells children exactly what part of the body they're to crossover from right to left and left to right so it's very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.\n\nCrossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right.

The main purpose of this channel is to provide a stimulating online learning environment for kids of all ages. \r\nA learning environment that encourages community,  acts as a guide for parents and promotes the individual skills as well as confidence in each child.\r\n\r\nThroughout my teaching experience, I have found that children earn best when actively engaged and provided with multiple forms of instruction. When children make connections to past experiences they will not only retain information longer, but they will also master material and become more confident in their own abilities.\r\n\r\nI am excited to provide an enriched educational experience to children from all over the world.\n\n\u00a9BlackBerryJamKidsMusic"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M14S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "177", "likeCount": "10", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "1pKeMStVmE3NTI3ufkSbeQaxKzM", "id": "ffsnfCuTlA0", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2015-09-02T03:31:09Z", "channelId": "UC3k4uS4rAiMD8CwnVRrL3cw", "title": "Brain Breaks   Action Songs for Children   Move and Freeze   Kids Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "Belajar Nari", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffsnfCuTlA0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffsnfCuTlA0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffsnfCuTlA0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffsnfCuTlA0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Arif Panto", "tags": ["Tayan", "english", "song", "dance", "SMK", "Cahaya harapan", "SMK Cahaya Harapan"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Brain Breaks   Action Songs for Children   Move and Freeze   Kids Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "Belajar Nari"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M1S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "641127", "likeCount": "1222", "dislikeCount": "314", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "182"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/04rlf"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "P4YSoAGfGYGZ2FtY7ROP3yXhmbQ", "id": "ytoqdGIgRiw", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-06T22:57:15Z", "channelId": "UC4Hdb26_xnPQsntwLazMqYw", "title": "Online Class #12 \ud83d\udc13Good Morning \ud83d\udc13 Brain Breaks \ud83d\udc13 Storytime \ud83d\udc13 Kids Songs by The Learning Station", "description": "Welcome to The Learning Station\u2019s online/virtual classroom for children.
