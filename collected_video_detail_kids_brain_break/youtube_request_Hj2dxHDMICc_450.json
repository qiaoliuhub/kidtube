The repetition in Peas Porridge is helpful in teaching kids how language works. Kids love to sing and dance along with the Peas Porridge with all the characters they know and love.\n\nNursery Rhymes help with a child\u2019s language development. Kids hear and say vowel and letter sounds repeatedly throughout the song, Peas Porridge.   Nursery rhymes are filled with alliteration. As they sing a nursery rhyme they get a sense for rhythm and can help develop other important language skills such as inflection. \n\nNursery Rhymes are also important as they are often where a child hears a word for the first time, building their vocabulary. Nursery rhymes are also a great introduction to sentence and story structure because they are short and easy to remember, making them repeatable, too. Nursery rhymes are good for simple story telling as they usually have an identifiable beginning, middle and end. Kids easily memorize and recall the stories, especially when the nursery rhymes are set to music.\n\nNursery rhymes can build a child\u2019s imagination as they need to visualize and often act out scenes in the nursery rhymes. Humpty Dumpty is a great example. Nursery rhymes such as Peas Porridge can help kids with developing gross and fine motor movements.\n\nWhat you may not know is nursery rhymes can also help develop math skills as well. Many nursery rhymes involve the use of number, such as three blind mice, but also nursery rhymes rely on patterning and sequence. Math vocabulary words for measurement can also be introduced, for instance weight. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning.\n\nNursery rhymes also aid kids in developing socially as the characters in nursery rhymes are often portrayed in a variety of situations. These situations teach children about understanding their emotions and the emotion of others and how to identify what these emotions are.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nPease Porridge\n\nPeas porridge hot, peas porridge cold\nPeas porridge in the pot 9 days old\nSome like it hot, some like it cold\nSome like it in the pot 9 days old.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4 & 5\n6, 7, 8, then the next number is 9.\n\nPeas porridge hot, peas porridge cold\nPeas porridge in the pot 9 days old\nSome like it hot, some like it cold\nSome like it in the pot 9 days old.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4 & 5\n6, 7, 8, then the next number is 9.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY3WHbjNL7U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY3WHbjNL7U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY3WHbjNL7U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY3WHbjNL7U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY3WHbjNL7U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Jack Hartmann Kids Music Channel", "tags": ["jack hartmann", "brain breaks", "children's songs", "educational songs", "kids music", "kids videos", "kids songs", "Nursery Rhymes", "Nursery Rhymes Song", "Pease Porridge", "Pease Porridge Hot", "Pease Porridge Cold", "Pease Porridge Song", "peas porridge hot", "peas porridge hot jack hartmann", "pease porridge hot nursery rhyme", "peas porridge hot nursery rhyme", "jack hartmann nursery rhymes", "peas porridge", "peas porridge hot with action", "jack hartmann peas porridge hot", "jack hartmann nursery rhyme"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Brain Breaks | Nursery Rhymes | Nursery Rhymes Song | Pease Porridge | Jack Hartmann", "description": "Peas Porridge is a traditional poem or song for young children.
