Example: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\nTIPS:\nIf you child points out the shape you did not name or says a name incorrectly, do not show disappointment or disapproval, but continue with a new request to check if it was a careless mistake or due to incorrect association of shapes and their names. If it is due to incorrect association then transition smoothly to the previous period in the lesson and repeat the process. If you child becomes frustrated, end the lesson leaving an impression of correct associations in Step 1.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nThank you for helping me grow Cheriebooks Kids Learning Channel by liking, sharing, commenting and SUBSCRIBING at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCacnSUkviry5AkhtdlAkDNQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nStay tuned in with weekly educational video updates for children, by SUBSCRIBING for FREE and then click on the notifications bell icon so you are reminded when a new video is published!\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n\nFind out more about Cheriebooks Educational Multimedia Interactive eBooks for Children at http://www.cheriebooks.com\n\n.............................................\n\n\nFOLLOW  at : \n  \nIG: https://www.instagram.com/cheriebooks/\nFB:  https://www.facebook.com/cheriebooks1/\nTpT: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Cheriebooks\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nMusic by Josh Molen (thetunepeddler.com)\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M39S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "46123", "likeCount": "346", "dislikeCount": "29", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/01k8wb", "/m/01k8wb"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "IZZXJhTzldyoSPnyEgty4qgai70", "id": "flYu_LjYI9o", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-01-27T12:30:03Z", "channelId": "UC6QbtQHzCQLxilVvWZbyC3Q", "title": "Shapes Song | Learn Shapes For Kids | Nursery Rhymes and Kids Songs", "description": "Learning is always fun with Super Supremes popular nursery rhymes.

Why is knowing how to count coins important?\nA. The aim is to teach children how to understand and use money. To do this they need to be able to count the money they have and to compare it to the cost of what they wish to purchase.\n\nQ.What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 2nd Grade. \n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur Counting Coins video is aligned with the following Common Core and TEKS standards:\n\nCommon Core Standard ( CCSS )\n\n2.MD.C.8 \nSolve word problems involving dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, using $ and \u00a2 symbols appropriately.

Why is knowing how to count coins important?\nA. The aim is to teach children how to understand and use money. To do this they need to be able to count the money they have and to compare it to the cost of what they wish to purchase.\n\nQ.What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 2nd Grade. \n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.
