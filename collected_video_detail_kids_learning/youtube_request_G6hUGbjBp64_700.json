2016, 2017, 2018  Kids Learning Tube\n\nLyrics:\n\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nlook in the night sky\nTo see a part of me\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nYour solar systems \njust a tiny part of me\n\nThe Milky Way name came\nfrom a Greek goddess named Hera\nWho spilled milk across the sky  \nGreeks believed in that era \n\nWhen you look at the darkest sky \non a clear summers night\nAnd you see the image \nof the Milky way clear in site\n\nRemember you can only see\na small part of me\ncalled the Galactic Core\nIn my galaxy\n\nAstronomers can\u2019t look at me\nfrom outside the galaxy\nBecause I\u2019m so massive \nand you don\u2019t have the technology \n\nBased on other galaxy\u2019s   \nwe see outside of our own\nIs why we conclude that our\ngalaxy\u2019s spiraled as I\u2019m shown\n\nWhen you look at a side view\nof the Milky way here\nYou see me as a flat disk \nwith a Bulge center I appear \n\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nlook in the night sky\nTo see a part of me\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nYour solar systems \njust a tiny part of me\n\nI was born about \n13.6 Billion years ago\nThat's a hypothesis \ngiven from astronomers though\n\nI am 100,000 light years\nin diameter \nThat's an estimate given by NASA\nthough they can\u2019t be sure \n\nYour Solar system\u2019s\nThis tiny dot that you see right here\nAstronomers think the Orion Spur\u2019s \nwhere your system appears\n\nYour systems guest to be\n25,000 light years \nFrom the galactic center \nof the milky way shown here\n\nAbout 230 million years \nis what your system takes\nTo orbit once around the milky way\u2019s \ncenter\u2019s cool shape\n\n200 to 400 billion stars \nlive in me\nthat's an estimate only \nbased on our astronomy \n\nOver 100 Billion Planets \nmight exist in me\nMaybe someday you can \nsee them in the galaxy\n\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nlook in the night sky\nTo see a part of me\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nYour solar systems \njust a tiny part of me\n\nLet's take a look at all the parts\nthat you think I\u2019m made of\nWe\u2019ll start by looking down \nat the galaxy from above\n\nThe Galactic Cores\nthe rotational center you can\u2019t see\nbecause of interstellar dust\nIt cannot be studied\n\nit\u2019s believed the center\nis a supermassive black hole\nWhen Astronomers find out more\nthen I will let you know\n\nYou\u2019ll notice a Galactic bar\nand also the Long Bar\nThen the 3kpc Arms\nThere is a Near and there\u2019s a Far\n\nThen we have the Sagittarius \nand the Norma Arms \nThen the Orion Spur\nWhere your solar system spins on\n\nThe Scutum-Centaurus \nand Perseus Arm\nAre two major spirals \nand full of the galaxy\u2019s charm\n\nFinally the Outer Arm \nand The New Outer Arm\nAre the final Spirals \nI will mention in this song\n\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nlook in the night sky\nTo see a part of me\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nYour solar systems \njust a tiny part of me\n\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nlook in the night sky\nTo see a part of me\nI am the Milky Way \nGalaxy\nYour solar systems \njust a tiny part of me", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PJ4TiiBglsw/default.jpg",
