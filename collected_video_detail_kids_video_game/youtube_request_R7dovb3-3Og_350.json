the group find out Demetra (Courtney Jines) has been deceiving them the whole time.\n\nFILM DESCRIPTION:\nThe first American theatrically released 3-D movie from a major studio since 1991's Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is the third entry in three years in Robert Rodriguez's family-oriented action-adventure series. Along with the four members of the Cortez family, played by Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega, and Daryl Sabara, most of the characters from the first two films have returned, including Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), Romero (Steve Buscemi), Machete (Danny Trejo), Dinky Winks (Bill Paxton), and Donnagon (Mike Judge). This time around, Carmen (Vega) is kidnapped by the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) and imprisoned inside a virtual-reality game. It's then up to Juni (Sabara) to venture into the game and save his sister from the villain's clutches. The film's three-dimensional segments take place inside the game. Also starring Salma Hayek, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is actually the first of two 2003 films directed by Rodriguez that complete a trilogy, the other being Once Upon a Time in Mexico, the third installment in the El Mariachi saga.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Miramax Films (2003)\nCast: Courtney Jines, Bobby Edner, Robert Vito, Ryan Pinkston, Sylvester Stallone, Ricardo Montalban, Daryl Sabara, Alexa Vega\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\nProducers: Elizabeth Avellan, Robert Rodriguez, Bill Scott, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein\nScreenwriter: Robert Rodriguez\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
