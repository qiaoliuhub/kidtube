The material doesn\u2019t seem to have durability for outdoor use. It can be a bit tricky to put it together. The two rods crisscross through the material along the top of the tent.\n\nThe rods at each end slid in a small pocket at each corner. Once one end in inserted in the pocket you\u2019ll need a little elbow grease to put the other end in. The rods are designed to bend in order to allow the tent to stand.
