Swing them around\nSide to side, up and down, now stop.\n\nChorus\n\nStand up straight, your shoulders back, your chest moves to the beat.\nNow bob you're your head in time with that, no stopping, just repeat.\nAdd your arms swoop lower now, twisting to the beat.\nMake your way back up, that move is complete.\n\nChorus\n\nHands on your knees now jump real small. It looks just like your sliding.\nJump left and right and all about and keep your legs real wide and\nUse your hands for attitude like to point or to POP!\nA \"Y\" hand means whatever, and an open hand means STOP!\n\nChorus\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M17S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "748320", "likeCount": "970", "dislikeCount": "385", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "24"}, "topicDetails": {"relevantTopicIds": ["/m/04rlf", "/m/0glt670", "/m/04rlf", "/m/0glt670"], "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Xbj6x1fKGjSif1rQkZCiFv2ATU8", "id": "uf0uKmKwnKs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-06-27T20:17:48Z", "channelId": "UCVcQH8A634mauPrGbWs7QlQ", "title": "Penguin Dance | Brain Breaks | Jack Hartmann", "description": "The Penguin Dance is a super fun song for brain breaks.
