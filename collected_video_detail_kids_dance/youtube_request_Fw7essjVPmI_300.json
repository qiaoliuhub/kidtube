This is Kid Glyde. I'm here to teach you guys some breaking moves. For this one, I'm going to show you some basics. Well actually, what a beginner should know. Straight up. All right? Beginners should know, of course, the four elements of breaking. The four basic elements. There's more elements, but we'll go into that later. So anyways, we got top rock; we got the footwork, freezes and power moves, the eye candy of the whole dance.\n\nAll right. With top rock, you should have at least three steps. Three steps, Indian step, cross step and at least a side step. The three and you can do the back step. Back step's easy. Footwork, six step, two step, three step. It's very important to have the six step. Kick outs, step outs. You should have all that in my first series. Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying?

When I kick my leg forward, I lean back.  You created an angle.  You created an illusion.  Look at that.  That doesn't look cool.  That looks better.
