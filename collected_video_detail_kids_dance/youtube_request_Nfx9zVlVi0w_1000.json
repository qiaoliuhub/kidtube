Now you're going to reach up with the right arm. One, reach with the left, two, reach with the right again. This time the right foot comes out, three, and four on the left side, left foot comes out this time. Left, right and a five as you're reaching, the waist is going to come on the outside.

And you're going to turn, four. You're going to hit, five. Left shoulder moves, hit six. Right shoulder moves, hold seven. Swing eight. One swing, two, three sway it, four, five, six, seven, eight. Mm-hmm. That last part one more time. So, you have seven, eight, the left is going to step and one, two, left foot steps again, and three, four, hit left shoulder, five, hit the right shoulder, hit six, hold seven, sway eight.

The first one is a pirouette. Here we go. You start with the preparation. Arms are in a nice L position, you step back with your right leg, ball, change, nice deep pli\u00e9 into the ground, you push off your back right foot into a pass\u00e9, and arms go into a round first position and then drop down to neutral. I\u2019ll break that down one more time. Ball, change, up, and down. \n\nA great way to break this down for kids or even beginner adults is to go in the box. Ball, change, hold, and down. Face to side. Ball, change, hold, and down. Face the back, ball, change, hold, and down. Face the side, ball, change, hold, and down. Face the front. Then you break it down into a half turn. Ball, change, face the back, and down. Ball, change, face the front, and down. Important is that the pass\u00e9 leg is completely connected to the knee, okay. So that it\u2019s pressed against, the core is activated, stomach is pressed down into the lower back and you\u2019re also holding your arms in a nice round position, lifting up through the body. \n\nAfter the half turns then you should try for a full turn. If you step on your right and pick up your right leg you turn to the right, and ball, change, up, and down. One more time, ball, change, up, and down. That can then go into a double, triple, quadruple, or five, six, seven, eight turns as the students become more and more advanced with turning. Double, ball, change, up, up, down. You should really try to teach to clean it in a nice parallel position. \n\nWe can also, and also you need to do that on the right and the left, which I\u2019ll show you with the music. Another basic jazz turn is an inward turn. Inward turns look like this. You start with a nice tombe, arms are prepared and then you pick up your left leg but turn towards your right, using your right arm. Up, and down. Again, the inward jazz turn is up, and down. Again, keep thinking about really pushing off that back leg into the pass\u00e9 right away. I\u2019ll show you to the left. Left arm opens, right arm closes, you push up into the pass\u00e9 and drop down. That\u2019s the inward jazz turn. \n\nSo there you are. Those are two very basic jazz turns that you can teach your students, inwards and outwards. Ball, change, pass\u00e9, and down. Side, ball, change, up, and down. Face the back. Ball, change, up, and down. To the side. Ball, change, up, and down. To the front half turn, and to the front. Try to hold that releve as long as possible. Now singles. One more time. Go for a double. Good job. All right you need to reverse that to the left. I\u2019m not going to do that right now, but you guys need to do that. So right and left are very, very important. \n\nAll right here are the inward turns. Nice tombe, and use your arms pull it up. Up, and down. Good, one more time. Up and down. Other side I will do this time. Up and down. One more time. Up and down. Good. Really try to sustain those turns and lengthen up through your torso.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpYZJf1p3SA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpYZJf1p3SA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpYZJf1p3SA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpYZJf1p3SA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpYZJf1p3SA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["Howcast", "what is jazz dance", "jazz dancing", "dance companies", "jazz shoes", "street jazz", "jazz sneakers", "jazz pants", "jazz costumes", "jazz dance songs", "jazz dancers", "jazz dance costumes", "jazz dance shoes", "jazz dance history", "basic turns"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Do Basic Turns | Jazz Dance", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF6166F725D8AA1DE\n-\n-\nWatch more Jazz Dance Moves for Beginners videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/501768-How-to-Do-Basic-Turns-Jazz-Dance\n\n\n\nI\u2019m going to break down a couple of basic jazz dance terms for you.

So, now these are some moves that if you are going to some eighties party, you can bust out on the floor, or even if you're at any party, like if you're at a club, or a wedding reception, or at a friends party, a friends house party. You can just bust these old school moves when you hear some old school music. All right, so for the first step we're going to do we are going to put all the weight on our left leg, we're going to hike up our right leg, and then at the same time we're going to push forward our left elbow. Okay? And you're going to do it, one, two. And then you're going to do the same thing, but the opposite. So, you're going to put all of your weight on your right leg, lift up your left leg, and then push forward your right elbow, three, four. So, you're going to do double, double, double, double, single, single and double, double. That's how we're going to do it. On the beat, here we go. Five, six, five, six, seven, go, single, double, single, single. Yeah.\n\nLaShonna: Awesome. The next step that we're going to do is an old school move called The Kid in Play. You can do it by yourself, but it's much better with a partner. So, Victor and I are going to show you The Kid in Play. All right, we're going to face the side, stepping first with our left foot, kick each other with the right, step back, do it again, step forward, and then we step back. This time, one, two, grab, three. Let's just do that much. Ready? Five, six, left foot step, left kick right, and then we step back, left kick right, and then we step back, left, one, two, grab, three. We're going to hop around four times. One, two, three, four, and that's The Kid in Play.\n\nVictor: Are we going to do it together?\n\nLaShonna: Sure.\n\nVictor: Okay. Five, six, five, six, seven . . . Clap, one, two, three, four. All right, and that's The Kid in Play. So, the next move is going to be?\n\nLaShonna: The Humpty Dance.\n\nVictor: Oh! The Humpty Dance. All right. So, this one is super simple. All you're going to do is wave your hands. Your right hand is going this was. Your left hand goes this way. Your right hand goes this way. Your left hand goes this way, and you see, naturally your body is leaning there, right? So, all you have to do now is just bounce. So, you just bounce right here. This is The Humpty Dump Bounce. All right? So, what you want to do now is apply that same motion with your hands with this bounce. Five, six, seven, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and that's how you Humpty Hump. Yeah, old school Humpty Hump.\n\nLaShonna: From the top?\n\nVictor: Yeah.\n\nLashawna: Let's put all three together . . .\n\nVictor: Yeah.\n\nLaShonna: . . . and pretend that we're at an old school party. All right?\n\nVictor: Yeah.\n\nLaShonna: Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight.\n\nVictor: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one . . . and that's how you do all three dances, right there.\n\nLaShonna: Old school.\n\nVictor: Old school moves.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvSnIj2Dfo8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvSnIj2Dfo8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvSnIj2Dfo8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvSnIj2Dfo8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvSnIj2Dfo8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["dance party", "party moves", "Howcast", "dance", "dance moves", "dance move", "dancing", "how to dance", "dance video", "dance lessons"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Do Old School Dance Party Moves | Sexy Dance Moves", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrhBM3T68vyiGknKGPbOOXki\n-\n-\nLike these Dance Lessons !!!

So, you go, shake, shake, shake, shake. Arms are going to switch, pelvis is going to switch. Step, step, step out, in. \n\nNow, Michael does a turn. The zombies go on the floor. You can choose to do both if you want. You can do a spin move, one, or you can do two spins. Whatever you're feeling. The zombies are going to go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You have one whole count of eight to come up as a zombie or you have two or three counts to do a spin. So, whatever you're feeling. That is your first four counts of the main chorus. \n\nLet us go back to the top and put all of that together. You're going to go five, six, seven, eight. A one, two, and a  three and a four. Shrug.

You can choose to do both if you want. You can do a spin move, one, or you can do two spins. Whatever you're feeling. The zombies are going to go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You have one whole count of eight to come up as a zombie or you have two or three counts to do a spin. So, whatever you're feeling. That is your first four counts of the main chorus. \n\nLet us go back to the top and put all of that together. You're going to go five, six, seven, eight. A one, two, and a  three and a four. Shrug.

It's not loose at all.\n\nYou're not even human, that's why you're a robot, that's why it's botting. So basically it deals with hitting a little bit. Hitting does help but not too much because robots don't hit all the time, they walk like a robot. So basically you have slow motion walks, you have regular walks.\n\nNow your slow motion walks can go in with your regular walks. You can be walking regularly like a robot and then just slow it down really slow, as so, but make sure you still look like a robot. While you're doing that you can isolate your body to move other places as well while you're robotting so it makes it very unique and unreal. So various stops with your arms, stops like with your right and left arms, right, left, right, left, right, left, right left, right, left, bing, up. You're moving one thing at a time. Don't go too fast; don't rush it because you won't look like a robot. You'll look human. \n\nSo when you do that you can do stops, one, two, three, four, turn head, neck. Everything is one at a time. That means everything is one at a time. Neck, head, torso, body, arm, arm, arm, arm, arm. Basically you get the point. Basically I'm going to start to routine off with walking. Make it very robotic. If you have to add your own little extra flavor in it, come around someway, however you want to, that's you.\n\nAnd when the routine starts you're going to go slightly forward and it's going to be like a retraction. So you're going to go back, boom like you hit the wall. So one, two, three, and stop. Take your right arm five, six with your left, and you're going to go up, seven, and eight. Now that itself is going to be like a back and forth. You're going to stop as so. \n\nSo let's try it again. You're going to walk very robotic turn head, left however you want to. Feet you can do in a different order, but when the routine starts you're going to go back, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and an eight.\n\nLet's try it again just from the start of the routine. Five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, and four. Five, six, seven, and an eight. You're walking, boom, boom, boom. Slow motion if you will, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two and three, and four, five, six, seven, and an eight. Now let's try that with music.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApIVO-1kVzY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApIVO-1kVzY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApIVO-1kVzY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApIVO-1kVzY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ApIVO-1kVzY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Howcast", "tags": ["howcast", "street dance", "street dancing", "dance moves", "dance video", "dance tutorial", "how to dance", "hip-hop", "how to robot"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How to Do the Robot aka Botting | Street Dance", "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDridwDTdAlUUqQ1E-aEqtGfu\n-\n-\nLike these Hip Hop Lessons !!!

FUNKMODE's got you covered! In this FREE instructional video, Mighty and KMDZ teach you step by step and with counts. The choreography we explain is from the original music video and falls between the moment when Michael first appears as a zombie to the beginning of the final chorus.\n\nWe made this video to be short, so we don't go over each step a ton of times. But don't worry because all of the essential info is there. Just run the video back as often as you need to until you get the steps. And MAKE SURE TO WATCH UNTIL THE END, because we finish the video with a non-stop walk through of the entire choreography.\n\nIf you have any questions, hit us up in the comments.

FUNKMODE's got you covered! In this FREE instructional video, Mighty and KMDZ teach you step by step and with counts. The choreography we explain is from the original music video and falls between the moment when Michael first appears as a zombie to the beginning of the final chorus.\n\nWe made this video to be short, so we don't go over each step a ton of times. But don't worry because all of the essential info is there. Just run the video back as often as you need to until you get the steps. And MAKE SURE TO WATCH UNTIL THE END, because we finish the video with a non-stop walk through of the entire choreography.\n\nIf you have any questions, hit us up in the comments. We read ALL of them, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nFinally ... enjoy! Now you can get your Thriller on at parties, dances or just in the middle of  the street.
