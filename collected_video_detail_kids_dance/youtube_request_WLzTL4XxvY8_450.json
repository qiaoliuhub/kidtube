Opposites and demonstrate MUVE's new Dancing Game- The Wave'. In this MUVE Dance Lesson, Maggie shows children that dancing the opposites help dancers creatively explore the full range of their movements. The Wave quickly became one of MUVE's favorite exercise activities for kids because of how the whole group can collectively dance and share their dancing ideas altogether. Enjoy over 20 MUVE Dancing Games explained and demonstrated at http://www.muve.com/muve-dancing-games/\n\nThe Wave is a group mirroring game, where each side takes turns inspiring the other with new dance moves. The first group collectively chooses a dancing concept that they will dance to the center line. In response, the second group first watches movement, learn it and echo it back. The Wave is a creative tool to reinforce the Opposite Dancing Concepts. In this version, instead of groups echoing the same movements, they will demonstrate the Opposite.

Group 2 watches their stiff movements and immediately dances loose and flexible like a noodle. \n\nMUVE is a free resource on how to dance for kids, adults and seniors.
