Healthy Living Series: Teaching Kids to Exercise at a Young Age\nby The Center for Better Health and Nutrition/HealthWorks! at Cincinnati Children's\n\nChelsey Lambert, Exercise Physiologist: \"Teaching kids to exercise at an early age is important because these habits are more likely to carry on when they get older.\"\n\n\"Three important things to remember when focusing on younger kids and exercise is: Make it Fun. They will most likely lose interest if it's boring.\"\n\n\"Make the exercise age appropriate. For example, planks for 60 seconds would not be appropriate for younger children.\"\n\n\"Use imagination. Animal noises, sounds, shapes, different mindful exercises are always fun.\"\n\n\"Here are a few helpful tips and ideas to help your preschooler exercise instead of screen time. Try an obstacle course. An obstacle course can help with coordination, large motor skills, concentration and team building. Cheer other kids on. Another great way to get younger kids moving is to try a scavenger hunt. This could be indoors or outdoors. Scavenger hunts help teach kids to walk longer distance and keep their mind engaged. Learn about nature or a specific topic.\"\n\n\"If you feel your child needs more quiet time but still want to decrease screen time, try a yoga video or yoga poses. Yoga is great for helping kids and help them with balance, core strength and flexibility.\"\n\n\"Dancing is also a fun way to keep kids moving. Try dancing with props, use ribbons or silly costumes that help to keep it fun. Try dances that they can remember. Play different games with music, for example, freeze tag, red light green light, hula hoop or jump rope.\"\n\n--\n\nThe funding for these videos was in part provided by Master Han and the Han\u2019s White Tiger Tae Kwon Do Annual Break-A-Thon.

Healthy Living Series: Teaching Kids to Exercise at a Young Age\nby The Center for Better Health and Nutrition/HealthWorks! at Cincinnati Children's\n\nChelsey Lambert, Exercise Physiologist: \"Teaching kids to exercise at an early age is important because these habits are more likely to carry on when they get older.\"\n\n\"Three important things to remember when focusing on younger kids and exercise is: Make it Fun. They will most likely lose interest if it's boring.\"\n\n\"Make the exercise age appropriate. For example, planks for 60 seconds would not be appropriate for younger children.\"\n\n\"Use imagination. Animal noises, sounds, shapes, different mindful exercises are always fun.\"\n\n\"Here are a few helpful tips and ideas to help your preschooler exercise instead of screen time. Try an obstacle course. An obstacle course can help with coordination, large motor skills, concentration and team building. Cheer other kids on. Another great way to get younger kids moving is to try a scavenger hunt. This could be indoors or outdoors. Scavenger hunts help teach kids to walk longer distance and keep their mind engaged. Learn about nature or a specific topic.\"\n\n\"If you feel your child needs more quiet time but still want to decrease screen time, try a yoga video or yoga poses. Yoga is great for helping kids and help them with balance, core strength and flexibility.\"\n\n\"Dancing is also a fun way to keep kids moving. Try dancing with props, use ribbons or silly costumes that help to keep it fun. Try dances that they can remember. Play different games with music, for example, freeze tag, red light green light, hula hoop or jump rope.\"\n\n--\n\nThe funding for these videos was in part provided by Master Han and the Han\u2019s White Tiger Tae Kwon Do Annual Break-A-Thon.
