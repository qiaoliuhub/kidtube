How does your home environment affect your child's development? Get the most practical answers here in this episode with Dr. Leila Masson, a consultant paediatrician who specializes in nutritional and environmental medicine for children.\n\n\nSPEAKER BACKGROUND:\n\nDr Leila  Masson is a consultant paediatrician who specializes in nutritional and environmental medicine for children. She is the mother of two wonderful, grown-up boys. She had a busy clinic in Auckland, New Zealand, for 14 years before moving to Sydney in 2016. She received her medical doctorate from the Free University of Berlin and did her paediatric specialist training at the University of California in San Francisco. She received her Master in Public Health from Harvard University and her Diploma in Tropical Medicine from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \n\nLeila has worked in the US, Europe, New Zealand, and volunteered for 2 years setting up a rural clinic in Pakistan. Dr Masson lectures internationally on the subject of children\u2019s nutrition and an integrative medicine approach to pediatric issues, including autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, behaviour issues, allergies, recurrent infections, and autoimmune diseases. She is the author of \u201cChildren\u2019s Health A-Z\u201d,  a parent\u2019s practical guide to natural and effective therapies for the most common health issues in childhood.
