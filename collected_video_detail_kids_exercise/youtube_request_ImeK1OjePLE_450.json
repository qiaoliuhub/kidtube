Most fail just because they try to make all the changes in one day. But it's not that simple. The best way is to make gradual improvements, such as lowering the daily food intake or slowly implementing a healthier diet.\nMotivating an overweight child to exercise can be especially challenging. If possible, it is wise to try introducing physical activity through a familiar medium. Since most kids watch cartoons and like stories, why not use that to your (and their) advantage?  Children workout as a part of playing a sport they like or just by doing what regular kids do. Kids exercising doesn't have to be a chore but it can be a fun experience. Why not try an interactive kids app (we all know kids love our iPads) which gets our young ones to exercise, dance and have fun while doing it. TV or computer time can work to your advantage; you just have to know how to do it.\n\nYuvi -- Story Aerobics for kids is an incredibly fun and entertaining way for kids to become more active.
