Being overweight isn't just about others calling your child fat, but it's far more than that. It has a whole set of other health problems and issues, which can have serious consequences.\nOff course lifestyle changes, which are needed to tackle this problem, can be an impossibly difficult task. Most fail just because they try to make all the changes in one day. But it's not that simple. The best way is to make gradual improvements, such as lowering the daily food intake or slowly implementing a healthier diet.\nMotivating an overweight child to exercise can be especially challenging. If possible, it is wise to try introducing physical activity through a familiar medium. Since most kids watch cartoons and like stories, why not use that to your (and their) advantage?  Children workout as a part of playing a sport they like or just by doing what regular kids do. Kids exercising doesn't have to be a chore but it can be a fun experience. Why not try an interactive kids app (we all know kids love our iPads) which gets our young ones to exercise, dance and have fun while doing it. TV or computer time can work to your advantage; you just have to know how to do it.\n\nYuvi -- Story Aerobics for kids is an incredibly fun and entertaining way for kids to become more active. The ten part series was developed in collaboration with experts in the fields of child development and professional training.

Throughout the incredible journey of Yuvi, our lovable main character, kids not only happily exercise, but also learn valuable lessons of working towards a goal, the importance of teamwork and compassion. And the best part is that they are having lots of fun while doing it!\n\nYuvi-story aerobics for kids takes you on an exciting adventure through ten beautiful stories.

The stories are designed in a way that motivates kids to exercise. They can develop their imagination and motor skills, while having incredible fun. Help your kids stay healthy fit and happy.

If Yuvi wants to save the balls, he will need the help of every child in the world because the balls are being guarded by dangerous birds, hungry lions and a herd of giant buffalo.\nTo help Yuvi avoid the birds, we have to squat down to the ground.

She lives 250 miles from my house. Her parents were nice enough to allow me, a perfect stranger, to come in and share their daughter with the world. Thank you, again. My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist from the United States. I hope to follow Myla as she develops. I hope to teach ideas to help her learn to move, crawl, sit and walk. I started this video series after questions came in from all over the world from people seeking assistance in helping children with low tone. The ideas I teach in this video are not appropriate for a much weaker child than the one featured in this video. I hope you find this idea useful and simple. \n\nMy website is www.pediatricPTexercises.com  My Facebook page is Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises. My informational books, \"A is for Autism,\"  \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Hips\"  and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Knees\" are available on Amazon. \"A is for ADHD\" should be available shortly. Do not hesitate to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com with questions, concerns or favorable reviews! Please note I am unable to provide treatment recommendations for a child I have not personally evaluated.\n\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos. I have reviewed and corrected the closed captions for this video so that you might understand what I am saying even if you don't speak English. I hope the directions below are helpful to you. \nTo turn on Captions, click CC in the bottom right corner of the video\nTo choose a different caption language:\nAt the bottom right, click Settings.

She lives 250 miles from my house. Her parents were nice enough to allow me, a perfect stranger, to come in and share their daughter with the world. Thank you, again. My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist from the United States. I hope to follow Myla as she develops. I hope to teach ideas to help her learn to move, crawl, sit and walk. I started this video series after questions came in from all over the world from people seeking assistance in helping children with low tone. The ideas I teach in this video are not appropriate for a much weaker child than the one featured in this video. I hope you find this idea useful and simple. \n\nMy website is www.pediatricPTexercises.com  My Facebook page is Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises. My informational books, \"A is for Autism,\"  \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Hips\"  and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Strengthening Exercises for the Knees\" are available on Amazon. \"A is for ADHD\" should be available shortly. Do not hesitate to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com with questions, concerns or favorable reviews! Please note I am unable to provide treatment recommendations for a child I have not personally evaluated.\n\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos. I have reviewed and corrected the closed captions for this video so that you might understand what I am saying even if you don't speak English.
