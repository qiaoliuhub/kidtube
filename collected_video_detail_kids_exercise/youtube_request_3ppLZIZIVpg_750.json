Child's pose is wonderful for opening up the lower back and the hips. So with child's pose, when you're pregnant, you have a belly to accommodate for. So Vicky's going to take her knees a lot wider than she normally would. From there, keeping her hips back, walk her hands forward until maybe her head can rest on the floor. Good. Then you can really stretch your arms forward. Stretch them nice and long. They don't have to be parallel. They can be slightly separated. With the forehead on the floor, just going to breathe gently, letting the air go all the way down the spine. Letting the hips relax towards the heels. Very nice. Come up. Bring your hands back, and lift your chest.\n\nThere's another variation for when you can't get down. Maybe your back is a little tighter. We're going to put two blocks on the floor, one for under the chest, one for under the head. Then we'll put a comfy bolster on top. Good. Vicky is going to lean forward. You may have to adjust this, and pull this a little bit for you. Good. Then the blocks make a lovely hole for her to put her arms through it. It's just like hugging a pillow. You'll have one cheek on the side so the neck can stretch out a little bit. The shoulder blades can relax off to the side, so the upper back gets a little bit room to breathe. The lower back and hips continue to stretch. Whenever you're ready, you can slowly bring your hands underneath your shoulders. Use your arms to assist you as you come up.

He is a young boy with Spastic Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy. His family wants to help me share treatment suggestions to help children like him across the world.  My clinic, Child and Family Development,  in Charlotte, NC, allowed me to use their facilities and their equipment to showcase Sebastian's skill and charming personality. We review techniques to reduce stiffness, encourage strength and control. I think you'll love spending time with him. Thank you to this family and my clinic for allowing this to happen.\n I also have available 3 children's educational books, \"A is for Autism,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\"   and now 2 professional books \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Hips\", and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Knees\" available on Amazon.  I have forthcoming \"A is for ADHD\" as well.  If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com. Please note: I am unable to provide treatment suggestions for a child I have not personally evaluated.\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos. I have reviewed and corrected the closed captions for this video so that you might understand what I am saying even if you don't speak English.

He is a young boy with Spastic Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy. His family wants to help me share treatment suggestions to help children like him across the world.  My clinic, Child and Family Development,  in Charlotte, NC, allowed me to use their facilities and their equipment to showcase Sebastian's skill and charming personality. We review techniques to reduce stiffness, encourage strength and control. I think you'll love spending time with him. Thank you to this family and my clinic for allowing this to happen.\n I also have available 3 children's educational books, \"A is for Autism,\" \"D is for Down Syndrome,\" \"C is for Cerebral Palsy,\"   and now 2 professional books \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Hips\", and \"Pediatric Physical Therapy Exercises for the Knees\" available on Amazon.  I have forthcoming \"A is for ADHD\" as well.  If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at amysturkey@gmail.com. Please note: I am unable to provide treatment suggestions for a child I have not personally evaluated.\nI am so honored to have people from all over the world watch my videos.
