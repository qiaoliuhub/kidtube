He got interested in this particular kind of sport as a kid. While studying at high school, he could already boast of a number of titles and at college, he was already representing Oklahoma Sooners. \nIn 2009 his NBA career began with playing for Los Angeles Clippers. He had been a part of the team for many years until transferring to Detroit Pistons in 2018. Also, the athlete was selected for All-Star games the whole 6 times.\nGriffin is accustomed to set goals and works really hard to make his dreams come true. But is he that successful in his personal life? Let\u2019s find it out right now!\n\nThe celebrity\u2019s father Tommy also used to play basketball in youth. After that he worked as a coach and was even a coach of the year in 1975, 1980 and 1994. It was Tommy, who inspired Blake to play and took responsibility for training him. In addition to that, he owned a gym.\n\nThe mother\u2019s name is Gail and she worked as a schoolteacher but is now retired. She is very proud of her stellar son\u2019s career heights in the sports industry and can be sometimes seen at his games, supporting him as much as she can.\n\nThe sportsman has a three-year older brother Taylor, who was born in 1986. He was also a part of the sports industry playing for Phoenix Suns, Dakota Wizards, Santa Cruz Warriors and other teams. He retired in 2016 and started dealing with Blake\u2019s multiple ventures. In such a way, he is now a Program Director of Team Griffin Basketball, a Chief Operating Officer at Blake Griffin Enterprises and a President of Team Griffin Foundation. As for his personal life, he is happily married to a woman named Marieka and together they raise two kids.\n\nComing closer to the athlete\u2019s relationship status, in 2011 he started dating Brynn Cameron, who used to work as sports marketing executive and an interior decorator. In addition to that she also tried her hand in acting and can be seen in a movie called Southland of the Heart. \nIn 2013 the pair welcomed their firstborn and in 2016 one more kid joined the family. The couple was already going to get married but Griffin shocked Brynn with a prenuptial agreement. In 2017 they called it quits but kept co-parenting their two children.\n\nIn 2013 a son Ford was delivered. It would be interesting to know that during one of the interviews, the athlete shared that parenthood changed him a lot and made a better person. He also added that it made him think about things in a different way.\n\nIn 2016 a daughter Finley became a cute addition to the family. Both children live with their mother but often spend time with dad. For instance, when Finley was 3, Blake took her and Ford to Disneyland for a celebration.\nThat is all.\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to our channel.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUflzHlA02g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUflzHlA02g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUflzHlA02g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUflzHlA02g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bUflzHlA02g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "The Skeleton", "tags": ["Blake Griffin family", "Blake Griffin wife", "Blake Griffin children", "Blake Griffin kids", "Blake Griffin son", "Blake Griffin parents", "Blake Griffin father", "Blake Griffin mother", "Blake Griffin siblings", "Blake Griffin brother", "Blake Griffin daughter", "Blake Griffin ex-wife", "Blake Griffin girlfriend"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Blake Griffin Family (Wife, Kids, Siblings, Parents)", "description": "If you are passionate about American basketball and don\u2019t miss a game, then you should definitely know such a talented and skilled basketball player as Blake Griffin.
