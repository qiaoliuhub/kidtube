Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be a pretty sweaty four minutes if you're doing it right. The structure of the program is as follows:\n\nWork out hard for 20 seconds...\nRest for 10 seconds...\nREPEAT.\nComplete 8 rounds.\n\nYou push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise. \n\nMusic: \"Old Town Road\" feat Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nThis is a very simple fitness activity we sometimes use to warm up the students in our elementary PE class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udeabDisclaimers:\n*This content was created using creative commons and fair use guidelines and no copyright is intended.
