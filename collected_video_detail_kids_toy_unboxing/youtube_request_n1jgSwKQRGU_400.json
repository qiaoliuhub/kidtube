I wish I had one of these when I was a little girl! This drawing board is for 3year s old all the way up to 10 years old! My youngest is one and as you will see in the video she was able to use it too and REALLY enjoys it as well. Tiffany Taylor is seriously OBSSESED with this drawing board. She normally gets bored of a new toy in less than a day but this toy she just can\u2019t put down! Tiffany loves to color but I have to admit that she gets too crazy with the crayons, she either ends up breaking them or miss the paper completely and get it all over the table. I don\u2019t know why but it NEVER crossed my mind to get one of these magnetic boards, it definitely would of made my life much easier! As a former preschool teacher I know how important it is to have your work tie their hands. This drawing board is great to encourage fine motor skills in your childs development. It is also a great way to encourage creativity and help children to learn how to express themselves visually.
