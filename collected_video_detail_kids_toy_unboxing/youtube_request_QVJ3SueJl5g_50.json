Stimulate creativity Skills Do it by yourselves, make a beautiful decoration and puts you in a good happy mood. Girls snap the beads cultivate their hand-eye cooperation skill. Easy Snap Design for ages 3 and up. Beads are connected by insert. It is simple and convenient to disassemble and assemble. These beads are made from Recycled Toys Perfect for parties, rainy days, or just having fun at the house, you can be with this fully reusable jewelry kit. Make it, wear it, remake it, and wear it again. BPA Free, The toy beads are sturdy and well-made, it is non-toxic. Best gift for girls beading and jewelry making,also a good idea for birthday and Chritsmas gift.\nReview by Davna (mom)- Once I received this DIY jewelry making kit I first looked at the packaging and I really like that it came in a plastic jar container that is really easy to open and close for Tiffany. The beads themselves are actually very well made, the quality  feels like beads that you would find at the Lakeshore Learning Store (except for HALF the price!) I love that the beads come in different textures, sizes and vibrant colors. It comes with a little booklet with pictures of some of the jewelry you can create which Tiffany liked to look at and recreated some of those accessories. The main thing I love about this toy is that it actually keeps both my girls entertained for LONG periods of time and it allows for their creativity to shine. We also use these to do some math, count and even create patterns! This is NOT meant for children under 3 as there are many small chocking hazard pieces BUT my youngest enjoys playing with them too under my CAREFUL supervision. It has been over a week now since we received this toy and since then both my girls have been playing with them DAILY! I highly recommend! \nCONS- The only con I found about this product is that some beads are harder to connect than others. Tiffany will be playing and be so nice and focused but then will have to come to me from time to time to help her snap some beads together which disrupts her (working) playtime. Tiffany is 4 years old so I know as she gets bigger she will be stronger and it will be easier for her to do completely on her own but if you have a 3 year old you will most likely have to play with them to help. My two year old already figured out which beads are harder to connect so she makes sure to only play with the beads that are easier to use lol \nSing King Karaoke https://youtu.be/dJgRhxg55fg\nNCS https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSoundsAxol x Alex Skrindo - You [NCS Release] Axol https://soundcloud.com/axol_music Alex Skrindo https://soundcloud.com/alex-skrindo\nTiffany Taylor LOVES toys,juguetes, \u0916\u093f\u0932\u094c\u0928\u0947, brinquedos, jouets, Spielzeug, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435, \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628, igra\u010dke, \u0111\u1ed3 ch\u01a1i, oyuncaklar, leksaker, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, juc\u0103rii, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043e\u043c, leker, \u0627\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc, zabawki, \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10, \u30c8\u30a4\u30ba, giocattoli, mainan, j\u00e1t\u00e9kok, \u05e6\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd, Hra\u010dky, leget\u00f8j, speelgoed, laruan, \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628, igra\u010dke, \u0111\u1ed3 ch\u01a1i, oyuncaklar, leksaker, juguetes, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, juc\u0103rii, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043e, \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1, Tiffany TAylor Kid Adventures LOVES them so so much!

Stimulate creativity Skills Do it by yourselves, make a beautiful decoration and puts you in a good happy mood. Girls snap the beads cultivate their hand-eye cooperation skill. Easy Snap Design for ages 3 and up. Beads are connected by insert. It is simple and convenient to disassemble and assemble. These beads are made from Recycled Toys Perfect for parties, rainy days, or just having fun at the house, you can be with this fully reusable jewelry kit. Make it, wear it, remake it, and wear it again. BPA Free, The toy beads are sturdy and well-made, it is non-toxic. Best gift for girls beading and jewelry making,also a good idea for birthday and Chritsmas gift.\nReview by Davna (mom)- Once I received this DIY jewelry making kit I first looked at the packaging and I really like that it came in a plastic jar container that is really easy to open and close for Tiffany. The beads themselves are actually very well made, the quality  feels like beads that you would find at the Lakeshore Learning Store (except for HALF the price!) I love that the beads come in different textures, sizes and vibrant colors. It comes with a little booklet with pictures of some of the jewelry you can create which Tiffany liked to look at and recreated some of those accessories. The main thing I love about this toy is that it actually keeps both my girls entertained for LONG periods of time and it allows for their creativity to shine. We also use these to do some math, count and even create patterns! This is NOT meant for children under 3 as there are many small chocking hazard pieces BUT my youngest enjoys playing with them too under my CAREFUL supervision. It has been over a week now since we received this toy and since then both my girls have been playing with them DAILY! I highly recommend! \nCONS- The only con I found about this product is that some beads are harder to connect than others. Tiffany will be playing and be so nice and focused but then will have to come to me from time to time to help her snap some beads together which disrupts her (working) playtime. Tiffany is 4 years old so I know as she gets bigger she will be stronger and it will be easier for her to do completely on her own but if you have a 3 year old you will most likely have to play with them to help.
