Jacob loves Marble Races so much, he quickly asked to buy this toy when we saw it in the store.  It has entertained our kids for hours and this specific version can be found at Toys R Us location.  The one we bought this time is named the Techno Gears Marble Mania Dual Speedway Marble Race.\n\nAbout the Techno Gears Marble Mania Dual Speedway Marble Race\n\nIn the olden days, kids raced one other using turtles scooped out of a pond or paper boats made out of their younger brother\u2019s birth certificate. The Techno Gears Marble Mania Dual Speedway hosts race after thrilling race without requiring kids to leave the basement. Young racers launch their marble into a tubular speedway, waving crumpled dollar bills as their orb plummets past panoplies of breakneck turns and moveable contraptions. Hundreds of colorful pieces comprise the towering set, which includes an LED display and audible countdown to the race launch.\n\nMarbles race one another in twin speedways\nHundreds of colorful construction pieces\nSound effects, including countdown to race launch\nTrophy with LED display\nCompete against friends or bogeymen bored of scaring you\nRecommended for ages 8 and up\nRequires two AA batteries (not included)\nDimensions (when assembled): 19.5\u201dx5\u201dx15.75\u201d\n\nThis Marble Race set is pretty cool, but has some significant flaws.  None of the pieces really fit together all that well and need to be adjusted pretty frequently.
