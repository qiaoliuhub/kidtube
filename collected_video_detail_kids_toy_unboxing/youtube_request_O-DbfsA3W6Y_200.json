Together, they form a team called Psi Patrol. Heroes are Chase, Marshall, Rubble, Rocky, Zuma, Skye and Everest (she joined the team in the 2nd Season, in the episode New Piesek).\nEach of the dogs has individual attributes assigned, for example Chase (pronounced: czejs) is a police dog, Marshall (pronounced: marshal) is a fire dog, Skye (pronounced: skaj) is a dog from tasks in the air (more information about heroes). Zuma is a specialist for tasks in water, Rocky (pronounced: roki) is a great fan of recycling, Rubble (pronounced: rabul) operator of excavator, bulldozer and other construction equipment. In addition to the characteristics typical of each dog, each puppy has its own vehicle, equipment used in rescue operations and a badge used to identify the dog and communicate with the other members of the team, with Ryder and the Control Tower.\n\nWelcome to the channel TheSurpriseEggs!

These toys are like the funco toys. Jazzy Puppet's FNAF Toys come to life and do Jumpscares in this Five Nights at Freddy's 5 Inch action figure toy review. Five Nights at Freddy's Toys for kids are super fun!  You will love this FNAF 5 Inch Articulated Funko toy unboxing with FNAF stop motion! The Five Nights at Freddy's toys are supposed to stay on the shelf, but they come to live, eat all of the dogs food, and then run away! Jazzy Puppet screams when the Five Nights at Freddy's Jumpscares happen! They are funny FNAF jumpscares though! Non of the FNAF Jump Scares are not scary. You will laugh at this funny Five Night's at Freddys Halloween Video for kids! Jazzy meets some really fun FNAF Toys! She Meets Freddy Fazbear, Toy Chika, Toy Bonnie, and Foxy! They come to live and are so funny! This is a FNAF not scary video for children to enjoy. The four Five Nights at Freddy's action figures are so cool! My favorite is the Toy Chica FNAF action figure, and I love FNAF videos! These are similar to FNAF Mcfarlane toys and come from the FNAF world! You will love this family friendly video. It is a super fun family friendly toy review for kids that is perfect for Halloween! Thank you for visiting the Jazzy Puppet Show! \nHere are the toys that she is Unboxing and doing a Toy Review on: \nFreddy Fazbear, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, Toy Chika, and Toy Foxy. This set is like the FNAF Funko toys! The FNAF toy set also came with a Golden Freddy Fazbear, but the Freddy bear didn't make it into the FNAF kid's video! Maybe next time Golden Freddy will come and play.
