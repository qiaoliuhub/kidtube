Then they try and get adventurous and go into the water... but the fish gets blown to the other side of the lake!   \n\nBackyard Bass is a fishing game that helps kids learn and practice how to cast.  It uses a weighted plug, so there are no dangerous, sharp fishing hooks while learning.  It can be used on a flat surface or in the water like a pool or lake (but don't let your fish get blown away!) \n\nThere are different sized sets from 3 to 16 for larger groups or just more fish to catch if you are casting over a large area. This toy game is especially for those aged 6 and up. \n\nWin the toy Connor reviewed on this video.

With the fate of Earth at stake, new heroes must rise in an epic struggle to forge a future for all. Kids can imagine joining the action with this Transformers: The Last Knight Autobot Sqweeks RC figure.  This Autobot Sqweeks RC figure features motion and sound effects that will inspire fans to shout 'Chihuahua' like the loveable Autobot amigo. Use the remote control to spin left and right or move forward and backward across the floor. The figure brings the exuberant personality of Autobot Sqweeks to life with peppy motion features and expressive LED lights and character sounds. Product does not convert. This Autobot Sqweeks RC figure features robot, blaster, and dance modes, each with different effects. Prepare Autobot Sqweeks for battle by switching into blaster mode with a movie-inspired weapon accessory. Or activate dance mode with energetic movement sequences accompanied by music and phrases. Imagine the feisty Autobot amigo charging into battle or grooving to the beat right in your living room. Autobot Sqweeks is the smallest among his fellow bots, but his spark shines just as bright. He\u2019s not one for a lot of words, but prefers to speak with action. Despite being in disrepair, he perseveres, and holds his loyalty to helping all living beings as his primary motivation.
