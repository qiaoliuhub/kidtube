The Transformers Robots in Disguise crash combers are so cool. In this RID comber force brand toy review episode we have crash combiner Dragbreak, who is combiner force of the decepticons Dragestrip and Wildbreak, and Shocknado, who is a combiner force of Shockdrive and Warnado. You can mix them up to create DRAGNADO with dragstrip and warnado and SHOCKBREAK with Shockdrive and Warnado. You can even combine the other Combine Force to make Autobot Decepticon robots to make PrimeDrag and Beeshock and all kinds of other crazy combinations in the Transformer universe. These one step transformer and Robots in disguise are so awesome! Mr Hands got mixed up on the names of Shockdrive and Warnado and Bobby thought it was really funny. Hr Hands needs to learn his Transformer RID name better. Transformers are so much fun to play with and use your imagination to pretend like you are on cartoon network. What happens when you crash and combine forces with Transformers Robots in Disguise Decepticon Shockdrive, Warnado, Dragstrip and Wildbreak figures? No, not a traffic jam. You get an awesome 2-bot Dragbreak Crash Combiner figure. Shocknado combines to send Autobots to their downfall. He electrifies their processors and jolts their systems into overload. All road and no rules makes Dragbreak a devious destructor. He\u2019s a bot bent on wreaking havoc on the roads.
